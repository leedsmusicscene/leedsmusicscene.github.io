        <h1>Unclejohnny - Untitled</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Untitled" recorded by Unclejohnny. The review was written by Richard Garnett in 2005.</p>
    <p>No it isn’t a typo that’s how they write it. Named after a family member of one of the band, Halifax’s grammar thwarters Unclejohnny are a 3 piece alternative outfit that have evolved out of an original studio project. Managed by a member of Domino back room band Clinic, there are not unsurprisingly one or two similarities in sound and approach. Less inventive but still interesting Unclejohnny go for the slow burn and brooding output. Dark opener Special Brew is to one man dull but another haunting, Skins however is a little more comfortable and has a Radiohead - Hail to the Thief era vibe in its guitar work. Necklace of Teeth is the bands best moment with a more distinctive beat carrying the song, before closing with the twisted mess-around instrumental Kill All Tourists. The band clearly enjoys the creative process of writing and experimenting but at present will probably struggle to get the same response from the general listener. It’s interesting stuff for future consideration.</p>
