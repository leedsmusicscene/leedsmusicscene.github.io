    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for The Hit and Runs.</p>
    <p>The Hit and Runs are a relatively new addition to the Bradford music scene who have been together since April this year. They have been gigging heavily since the end of May and have supported the likes of The Pigeon Detectives, Cardboard Radio, Shut Your Eyes And You'll Burst Into Flames, The Bazzars and Scottish band The Needles on two occasions.<br />
<br />
The band consists of Joe Maguire (Rhythm Guitar/Vocals), Andrew Fielding (Bass) and Matt Nixon (Drums). Anyone who has seen the band live recently may recognise them as a 4-piece, however Paul Mungovin has decided to leave the band and they are now officially a 3-piece band.<br />
<br />
Joe and Matt decided to form a band at the beginning of the year whilst working together. They advertised for a bass player but had little joy and it was through a chance meeting with an old friend that they came into contact with Andrew who was quick to take the role.<br />
<br />
The Hit and Runs describe their influences as "Anything catchy, quirky, with a bit of a bounce" and admit that they are "partial to the rising indie scene coming out of Yorkshire". They were given a very early chance to play with one of the big guns coming out of Leeds when they supported The Pigeon Detectives in what was their second ever gig (The day after their first ever gig). This is marked down as one of their best gigs to date as well as their recent gig at The Primrose which was their first as a 3-piece and was their "best response from the crowd ever"..</p>
