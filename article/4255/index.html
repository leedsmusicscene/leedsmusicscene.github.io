    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Untitled" recorded by All My Friends Are Dead. The review was written by Lewis Denby in 2005.</p>
    <p>Another group to add to the new movement of Leeds-based post-rock outfits, All My Friends Are Dead arrive with a three-track debut demo that, while showcasing a promising musical style, still feels a little unfinished.<br><br>The main problem here is that none of the songs sound tight enough: everything is a bit uncertain and the musicians do seem to lack real 'togetherness' at the moment.  Still, they've only been together a few months, and this considered it's by no means a cacophonous sound.<br><bR>Quite to the contrary, in fact: there's some lovely guitar work here, topped off by some absolutely mesmerising vocals from singer Nic Burrows.  It's a shame there aren't more of them: opener Black Orpheus only features a couple of lines, and Seven Eight Song is instrumental.  Tellingly, closing number For Our Friends and Future Wives is the strongest track on offer here.</p>
