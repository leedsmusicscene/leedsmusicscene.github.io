    <p>Funk band Capri from Leeds have released their first album on the label GLP. Released on the 29th May 2004 "Boogie Man" is receiving rave reviews and is picking up airplay on radio stations all over the world. Capri's style emulates the great Funk bands of the 1970's like Earth Wind and Fire, Average White Band and Sly and the family Stone but their sound is fresh and new with all original tunes and a strong emphasis on songwriting. Capri formed in 1995 originally as an instrumental soundtrack Funk band led by Dan Woodward ( drummer, writer / arranger ) but were later joined in 1998 by vocalist Benson Walker and the band took on a new direction. Capri made their recording debut in 2000 with the release of their CD EP "Earth Songs" on the label GLP ( Groove Laboratory Productions ). Following the success of "Earth Songs" Capri launched two vinyl singles in 2001 and 2003 "Car Chase on Phoenix Avenue" and "Boogie Man" the latter becoming the title track of their debut album which was released in May 2004. To purchase Capri's music on CD please visit www.caprimusic.co.uk where you can also buy T-shirts and other merchandise. Alternatively Capri tracks are available from iTunes, Rhapsody, Napster, Virgin Digital, Emusic, MSN, Passalong and Audio Lunchbox..</p>
