        <h1>Happy Daggers - Dirty Disco</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Dirty Disco" recorded by Happy Daggers. The review was written by Jordan Fearnley in 2014.</p>
    <p>In the past, Happy Daggers have released some decent indie-disco tunes: dry but tasteful. Now they have had their fingers in a variety of pies, and feet mudded by plenty of festivals, it's about time they got dirty. I mean filthy.<br /><br />	Upon first listen of their latest EP 'Dirty Disco' (Phat Mannequin Records), I noticed the bass is fatter and grittier than ever, yet the vocals have never sounded sweeter. The guys have obviously put a lot of effort in to texturing in keys, effects, and noise in between the high and low end. The Daggers' ever-improving sound has never strayed from their distinctive two-step-like-no-one-is-watching feel. Not cheesy, just immense party music (four-to-the-floor party music that isn't, urgh, house). <br /><br />	Happy Daggers should fill venues with their thumping hits exactly like they did at the late, great Cockpit earlier this year. Get on your dancing shoes and let loose.</p>
