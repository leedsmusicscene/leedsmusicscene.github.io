        <h1>The Hightones - The Attic Tapes</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "The Attic Tapes" recorded by The Hightones. The review was written by Rory Holl in 2005.</p>
    <p>Oh yeah baby, bring back that rock and roll! Only - if they could play and sing that would be great, but with out of tune vocals and guitars throughout I must say that from listening to this first track “Till The Night Is Through” I am NOT impressed. Bloody hell how horrible is that guitar solo?!!<br><br>Whoa! The second track comes out in the form of a frantic blues rock song called “Love Ain't No Good” with the rolling snare and the crazy acoustic guitar - this is not a bad tune at all but yet I think the vocals spoil it a bit.<br><br>The next few tracks are of the same calibre; nice tuneful, bluesy, semi-acoustic or dirty electric hits of sentimental soft rock blues, oh and a harmonica... I just can't really stick this guy's singing voice, probably a matter of taste but it's just how it is.<br><br>This CD isn't terrible, but really it isn't that great. The Hightones could try developing more of an interesting sound for them - I like blues guys but not how you play it, maybe some more experience down the pipeline and a new singer could really fall in your favour.</p>
