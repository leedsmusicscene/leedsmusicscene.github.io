    <p>Slam Dunk Festival has today announced that it is launching a local bands competition for its festival in the summer, with one slot up for grabs at each of the local legs of the Slam Dunk Festival. <br /><br />The Slam Dunk Festival takes place at six locations across six days in May and to ensure bands compete to play in the festival closest to their hometown, organisers have split the country into six sections: North, South, Midlands, Scotland, Ireland and Wales. These correspond to one of the six Slam Dunk Festivals respectively.<br /><br />Bands will compete for a space on each show based on their location, which means that bands based in West Yorkshire will compete for "Slam Dunk Festival North" which takes place at Leeds University on Saturday 25th May.<br /><br />The rules for entering the competition are simple. Bands need to ask their fans to vote by emailing competitions [ at ] slamdunkmusic.com with their band name as the first word in the subject and a link to the band's Facebook page in the body. That's it.<br /><br />It is strictly one vote per email address of course and bands will be entered into their local Slam Dunk Festival show. <br /><br />Email voting will run from today until Friday 5th April. A judging panel will then pick 5 bands for each date to form a shortlist. This shortlist will be published on Wednesday 17th April, and ultimately it is down to the fans again who will decide who wins a slot on each date by voting from the shortlist on Slam Dunk's Facebook page.<br /><br />The line up for Slam Dunk Festival North currently includes All Time Low, Four Year Strong, Sleeping With Sirens, The Skints, Pierce The Veil, The Early November, We Are The Ocean, The Wonder Years, Memphis May Fire, Streetlight Manifesto, Allister, Deaf Havana, Andrew McMahon, King Prawn, Senses Fail, Woe Is Me, Polar Bear Club, Man Overboard, Transit, The Summer Set, Mallory Knox, MC Lars, Fireworks, The Story So Far, Handguns, Hands Like Houses and more.<br /><br />Tickets can be purchased via Leeds Gig Tickets.</p>
