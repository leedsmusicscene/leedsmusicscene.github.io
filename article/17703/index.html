        <h1>The Kaiser Chiefs Make a Face at Poverty in Leeds</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2013.</p>
    <p>Local lads and international rock superstars the Kaiser Chiefs are amongst a host of celebrity, political, corporate and sporting figures supporting 'Hour Leeds' a charity initiative that fights poverty within the local community.<br /><br />The charity invited celebrities from across the UK to spend an hour of their time designing a clock face for Hour Leeds' latest charity fundraising event entitled 'Clockworks', an exhibition in Leeds opening 21st June and running for 7 days, that gives the public a chance to bid on, and own, a piece of art created by their favourite celebrity.<br /><br />A long list of celebrities has already pledged support, with musicians the Kaiser Chiefs, Alison Moyet and Julian Lloyd Webber taking the time to create one-off original pieces of hand-crafted art for the exhibition. Paul Collingwood, Nicola Adams, Peter Lorimer and Jamie Peacock represent local sporting heroes. The exhibition also features works from playwright Sir Alan Ayckbourn CBE and the Prime Minister, David Cameron, who have kindly submitted a clock face for this very worthy cause.<br /><br />Following the exhibition, the clocks will be auctioned to raise much needed funds for the Hour Leeds campaign to help destitute families in the area.<br /><br />All designs can be viewed at hourleeds.blogspot.com or on the Hour Leeds Facebook page: www.facebook.com/hourleeds2013 where bids can be made by email up until 5 July.<br /><br />The Hour Leeds campaign highlights the problem of poverty faced by people at a local level and asks members of the public to donate one hour of their earnings to the charity to help people who live close by.</p>
