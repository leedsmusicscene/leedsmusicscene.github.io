    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for The Beat Marshals.</p>
    <p>After a number of years in and around the Leeds Music Scene under various guises, The Beat Marshals formed at the back end of 2007 when Dan Schofield and fellow guitarist Chris Simpson collaborated to create a fresh dynamic sound. <br /><br />Drummer James Turton - having worked with the two guitarists in a previous outfit - completed the line up, and in October 2008 The Beat Marshals unleashed their high energy progressive indie rock onto the Leeds Music Scene.<br /><br />With a solid foundation based on dedication, self-belief and no fear to tread into the unfamiliar, The Beat Marshals distinctively fuse elements of 70's riff based rock, grunge, old school British indie and contemporary electronica, driven by intense beats and thunderous bass whilst demonstrating breathtaking melodious qualities.<br /><br />In May 2009, Naz Nordin joined The Beat Marshals on bass guitar to offer the band his distinctive playing style, combining pulsing grooves with slick riffs.  Naz is already proving his worth as a real asset to the band.<br /><br />The Beat Marshals took part in the 2009 Surface Unsigned Festival in which their semi-final showcase at Club Academy, Manchester, saw the band earn more audience votes than any other band on the night.<br /><br />The Beat Marshals are set to build on the strong impression they have created on the unsigned music circuit..</p>
