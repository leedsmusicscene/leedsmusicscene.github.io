        <h1>4 Letter Holiday - Undecided</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Undecided" recorded by 4 Letter Holiday. The review was written by Paul Drake in 2006.</p>
    <p>It would be great if bands could review their own demos for a week or two. I wonder what kind of press-pack garbage would be submitted?<Br><Br>‘The band harnesses raw talent with pop sensibilities’ could be the studious approach. Or what about the naïve approach, ‘Get these guys a record deal… RIGHT NOW!’ Then there’s the bullshit approach, ‘500 copies of the EP were sold in the first fortnight, and it’s easy to see why’.<Br><Br>There are so many clichés to avoid whilst writing. Like almost everything, it has probably been done before. Bare this in mind.<Br><Br>So what would 4 Letter Holiday write to describe their ‘Undecided’ demo? I can but hazard a guess, but it would probably be something a little like this:<Br><Br>‘4 Letter Holiday are Jon Spencer on his way to a Led Zeppelin convention; armed to the teeth with ‘Sonic Flower Groove’-era Primal Scream riffs and baying for the blood of Bush et al.’<Br><Br>A decent effort I’d say. Dramatic yet understated. Appeals to the right audience. Doesn’t stray too far from the truth. You can use that on your website if you like guys.<Br><Br>In all honesty though, 4 Letter Holiday are quite dull. The same Cock-Rock riffs are churned out, only with new hands and updated lyrics. I’m not a fan of Blues and particularly not Pub-Blues; it’s just been done to death.<Br><Br>This is a band you might see playing on the back of a wagon at ‘The Dog & Ale’ on an insipid July Sunday. Locals tap along whilst children named ‘GerEreYaLirrelBastard’ run riot in concrete Beer Gardens/Car Parks. Leather-clad relics stop to admire the new breed of Rockers, and Landlords count the cash.<Br><Br>A depressing image, I’m sure you’ll agree.<Br><Br>This demo was a chore to listen to, just as this review has been a tribulation to write. So now it ends.<Br><Br>Mr Dreg to you.</p>
