    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2010.</p>
    <p>The sixth annual Art of Record Production Conference will be hosted by Music, Sound & Performance at Leeds Metropolitan University.<br /><br />The conference will be held on Friday 3 - Sunday 5 December 2010 at James Graham, Headingley Campus, Headingley, Leeds, LS6 3QS.<br /><br />The keynote speaker for the conference will be Steve Albini who has recorded with over a thousand bands, including The Pixies, Nirvana, and P.J.Harvey.<br /><br />Steve is well known for refusing to call himself a Record Producer. He is also renowned for his forthright opinions on the superiority of analogue recording technology, his preference for group recordings over overdubbing, his disdain for the major labels and his ethical stance on flat fee payments rather than 'points' for his recording work.<br /><br />The conference will focus on the idea of Change and Continuity, and Steve's talk is no exception. He will speak about Change and Continuity: Transformations, Innovations and Tensions in the Art of Record Production.<br /><br />Paper submissions were also invited, based on themes around Alternative Sound Realities, Songwriting and the Studio, Music Production and Education, and Electronic Technology and the Production of Music. Workshops, presentations and performances will be held by the successfully chosen individuals on the day.<br /><br />To find out further details and to book your place, visit the Art of Record Production Conference website.<br /><br />Article reproduced with permission from the Leeds Met site.</p>
