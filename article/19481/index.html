    <p>Leeds-based rockers The Brazen will release their mischievous new single Laser Lips & debut album on Friday 13th May. The single is the second track to be taken from their debut album of the same name and is a dancefloor-filling future indie-pop anthem sure to get feet moving this summer.<br /><br />Since forming in early 2015, the five-piece have been tearing up venues around the UK and picking up fans at every gig. United by shared influences & musical cornerstones The Stone Roses, Queen & The Who, their combination of classic rock sounds and Britpop melodies has also gained national and regional radio airplay and glowing online press. <br /><br />The boys' debut album was recorded with talented producer Ed Heaton (production credits include Jon Gomm, Fold, Daniel Pearson, NARCS & more) in January and channels the glory days of 90's indie into a vibrant set of guitar-led pop rock tunes. With a string of sold out shows and a performance at Elland Road already under their belt, 2016 will be a great year for The Brazen.<br /><br />The band will be celebrating the release of the new album with the following headline live dates, including a launch show in Leeds on 27th May:<br /><br />12th May - London, Dublin Castle<br />27th May - Leeds, Milo<br />23rd July - Birmingham, Actress & Bishop<br />30th July - Manchester, The Live Room</p>
