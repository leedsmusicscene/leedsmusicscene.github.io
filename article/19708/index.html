    <p>Kill The Silence, a Post-Hardcore band from Leeds, West Yorkshire, have announced a special Christmas headline show at Santiago Bar in Leeds City Centre, following a monstrous return at the 360 Club this month, complete with new music, and new faces.<br /><br />Consisting of long-time members: Jason Walsh (Lead Vocals, Rhythm Guitar) and Sam Rickerby (Lead Guitar). Kill The Silence are joined by two promising new faces in the form of Joe Del-Grande (Drums) and Chris Beal (Bass). After an overwhelmingly successful return performance on Friday 25th November, the band announced the Christmas special the day afterwards and witnessed a flood of fans, new and old, rushing to online stores and guaranteeing their attendance.<br /><br />A statement from the band, outlines that they realise, around the Christmas period, a lot of people cant afford tickets to see their favourite bands. "In a time where we are rushing around buying gifts for our loved ones, a lot of people don't have time or money to go out and have fun in the run up to Christmas. We decided to give the fans a gift of our own in the form of this show, the tickets are cheap, its local and we just wanted to give people a break, for them to be able to let their hair down for one night in an otherwise stressful few weeks" explained frontman Jason Walsh.<br /><br />The band will be joined by support acts; They Say Fall, Accident/Happy and Curses & Cures on Tuesday 20th December for an intimate show at capacity of 100, leaving the tickets in high demand. With a good portion of tickets already allocated, it will not be long until Kill The Silence's triumphant return will fly the 'Sold Out' banner.<br /><br />Tickets for 'Christmas The Silence' are on sale now through the official Kill The Silence webstore for Â£1.50, while stocks last.<br /><br />Find 'Kill The Silence' on Facebook at @KTSilenceOfficial</p>
