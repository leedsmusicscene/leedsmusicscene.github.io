    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2011.</p>
    <p>Gang Of Four have unveiled the video for 'You'll Never Pay For The Farm', one of the stand-out tracks from their forthcoming new album 'Content', which is released on the 24th January via Gronland Records.<br /><br /><iframe title="YouTube video player" class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="560" height="345" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/9JL6ZLQaf2E?rel=0" frameborder="0"></iframe><br /><br />Alongside this video the band have also made the track available to download for free.  You can get the track below:<br /><br /><br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br /><br /><br />Entitled 'Content' - the band's first album of new songs for sixteen years - this brand new Gang Of Four record sees founding members Jon King and Andy Gill continue to deliver intelligent and liberating music that is both provocative and thrilling.<br /><br />New tracks include 'Who Am I?' 'You Don't Have To Be Mad', 'I Can't Forget Your Lonely Face' and 'I Party All The Time' and they reveal Gang Of Four to be just as challenging and unconventional now as they were in 1978.<br /><br />The album will be available in a standard CD release and on vinyl. It will also be available in a limited edition Ultimate Content Can which contains six booklets, the first containing the new album on CD, the second featuring an art piece Jon and Andy have created to depict the last 40 years of world history (composed of a series of twenty drawings and montages), and subsequently a book of lyrics, a book of Rotoscoped photographs of the band's emotions, a book containing sachets of Jon and Andys' blood and a scratch and sniff booklet which reflects the key areas of human activity.</p>
