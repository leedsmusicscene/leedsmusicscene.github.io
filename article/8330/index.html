    <p>Looking to play at Leeds Festival 2007? Well, look no further, as Futuresound 2007 is now officially accepting applications. Now in its 7th year, the Futuresound competition is once again looking to find six of the region's best, up-coming bands and musicians to play at the Carling Weekend: Leeds Festival.<br /><br />Last year, it was bands like Breaking The Illusion, Dead Disco and The Hair that caught everyone's attention and took the top prizes and the organisers are hoping that this year will be even better.<br /><br />From the hundreds of applications, Futuresound organisers will select the best thirty bands to play at one of 10 three-band heats during July. Each gig will be judged by two music industry judges, along with an audience vote. The top six bands will be revealed once all heats have been completed.<br /><br />For the second consecutive year, the overall winner of Futuresound 2007 will play on the Carling Stage at the Leeds Festival, with the remaining five runners-up appearing on the Unsigned Stage.<br /><br />Futuresound 2007 organisers are now accepting applications - send in your demo CD, along with a completed application form, band photo and short biog.<br /><br />Download an application form now - the deadline for entries will be the Friday 18h May.</p>
