    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for Bridewell Taxis.</p>
    <p>Bridewell Taxis re-formed after a 14-year absence with a triumphant hometown show in front of a sell-out crowd at Joseph's Well in October.<br><br>The gig sold out in less than 48 hours, tickets were exchanging hands on e-Bay for over £100, and demand far exceeded supply.<br><br>The new-look Bridewells feature original members Mick Roberts (vocals), Sean McElhone (guitar) and Glenn Scullion (drums). The trio have been joined by Jools Metcalfe (guitar and vocals) and James Metcalfe.<br><br>The original line-up disbanded in 1991 after recording five singles and an album which stayed in the Indie top 10 throughout the summer of 1991. The Bridewells were the first Leeds band to sell out the Town Hall and they also played to full houses at The Duchess, The Warehouse, and Leeds University.<br><br>The band also played support slots to the Inspiral Carpets, Happy Mondays, the Stone Roses and The Farm as well headlining one-off shows in Blackpool and Paris.<br><br>Gone is the brass section so symbolic of the Bridewells between 1989 and 1991, but the sound has been replaced by the addition of an extra guitar and is more powerful than ever before.<bR><br>Long-time fans will recognise re-worked versions of Honesty, Face in the Crowd, Give In, Spirit and Whole Damn Nation among others, while the Joseph's Well audience were also treated to a rendition of new tune, Change the Way I Feel.<br><br>The Bridewells were talked into re-forming by long-time pal Mick Tobin and Sean McElhone launched the band website to test the water. The interest was overwhelming and to satisfy the demand, the new-look line-up got together in the summer of 2005.<br><br>The comeback gig received rave reviews in the local media..</p>
