    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for The Bluefoot Project.</p>
    <p>The Bluefoot Project are an amalgamation of urban heads. Formed in 1997 and sharing a variety of musical backgrounds they set about fusing many different styles into a vocal-led, beat-driven, 21st century soulful funk with nods in the right direction to reggae, hip hop, gospel and leftfield.<br />
<br />
In 2000 they approached newly formed Northern independent Chocolate Fireguard who started gigging them around the club and festival circuit in the UK. Following an amazing set at Glastonbury Festival it was decided that the time was right to release their debut "Observations EP'.<br />
<br />
In 2002 top tune "Soma" found its way onto the essential Chocolate Fireguard compilation "Taster ... Sounds From The Funky Underground Volume 2" further establishing the band's reputation, the band hit the road again and debut album "Brave" came out in 2003 to some serious critical acclaim.<br />
<br />
Over the years, The Bluefoot Project have grown musically together and are now widely known for their unique sound which combines influences like Massive Attack, Squarepusher, Lamb, Goldie, Stevie Wonder and King Tubby.<br />
<br />
Straight to the point and distinctly urban, they kick out a cool live soul with deep grooves over lush sample based technologies and produce clever, but airy song structures with enough space to let Rachel Modest's nebulous vocal experience shine through. Debut album "Brave" was one of only four imports chosen for British Phonographic Industry's "Best of British" Virgin Megastores USA and in one month the 5th most requested CD on LA radio station KCRW.<br />
<br />
Some reaction to 'Brave':<br />
<br />
"what an magnificent piece of work" Mary Anne Hobbs, BBC Radio One (track "Concrete" was her "Breezeblock Bomb" of the week!) <br />
<br />
"Fans of Massive Attack and Grand Central your new favourite band is here...stunning" Muzik<br />
<br />
"This girl could sing the telephone directory and still break your heart" DJ<br />
<br />
"Hands down, the most powerful album I've had the pleasure of listening to this issue....anyone with a heart needs to hear these sounds. Soulful music with a breakbeat edge has never sounded so good. Buy this today." Knowledge<br />
<br />
".......all the hallmarks of a chilled classic" Record Collector<br />
<br />
"something special to witness here...a voice that is made in heaven, lyrical content that reflects a social conscience and an exploration into arrangement that has you hooked before you could utter Burt Bacherach is how to view Rachel Modest" Straight No Chaser<br />
<br />
"captivating" MOJO<br />
<br />
"Impressive debut, a collection of songs that rewards repeated listening" IDJ <br />
<br />
"An early contender for album of the year" DIVA<br />
<br />
"Smouldering fusion of raw soul, tortured blues, slick jazzy break beats and gritty funk" Metro <br />
<br />
"...with a voice that could turn a gentle breeze into a hurricane, this will without doubt blow you away" (album of the issue) Undercover.</p>
