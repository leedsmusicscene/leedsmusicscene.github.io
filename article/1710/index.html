    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for The Downfall.</p>
    <p>Dunk Bray - vocals/guitar<br />Dan Westbrooke - bass/backings<br />Wally - drums<br /><br />Formed in Leeds, The Downfall first pricked up ears in 1999 with a 3K (3 out of 5) review of their self released 'Roadkill' EP in national rock magazine KERRANG! when frontman Dunk Bray was still only 16. The positive review and exposure in the national music press resulted in interest from a number of record labels and led to a torrent of fan mail from all over the UK.<br /><br />Over the next few years the band continued to build a substantial following on the local scene, playing at local festivals, live on local radio and gigging regularly at the legendary 'Duchess' in Leeds, as well as putting out several other self releases - 'Real Lies' (July 2000), 'Headown' (June 2001) and 'What You Will' (Sept 2001).<br /><br />Gigging and writing hard throughout 2002 sharpened the band's focus and determination and resulted in the self release of the 'Atrofeed' mini album by April 2003. 'Atrofeed' was very well received by underground music media and secured the band a review in national music magazine RockSound.<br /><br />The release of 'Atrofeed' was supported by extensive touring across the UK and saw the band play over 70 dates between 2003 and 2004 in promotion of the record.<br /><br />After being impressed by one of the band's live performances in York (UK), booking agent No Code Music (Amen, The Wildhearts, Anti Product, Laruso, Vanilla Ice), asked The downfall to join their rapidly expanding roster and now deal with all of the band's live bookings.<br /><br />During the spring of 2004 the band signed with local independent label Voltage Records (Bradford, UK) and by August that year began putting down material for their first full length record and label debut 'Transporter'.<br /><br />In April 2005 Voltage Records released Gnarly Dude 2, a skate inspired compilation hosting bands from all over the UK and US, including an offering from Chuck Treece (ex Bad Brains) and featuring an early mix of one of The downfall's 'Transporter' tracks 'Over Now'.<br /><br />'Transporter' sees the band taking a generally heavier direction than on previously recorded material, effortlessly blending rock, alternative and pop to produce by far their best and most diverse recording to date..</p>
