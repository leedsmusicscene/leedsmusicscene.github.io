    <p>Angular Records have announced the release of 'Tina Weymouth', the third single to be taken from the critically lauded self-titled debut album by Leeds band This Many Boyfriends. <br /><br />Set for release on January 21st 2013 and lovingly produced by The Cribs' Ryan Jarman, 'Tina Weymouth' is not just an ode to the Talking Heads bass player; it is also a cautionary tale. You see, a great song can make you excitedly scrawl your hero's name on your t-shirt, but it can also make you foolishly take a first date to a dusty old record shop. Pop music can bring you ultimate joy and it can eat you up, be warned.<br /><br />Listen to the track below:<br /><br /><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F49569191"></iframe><br /><br />More than the average indie-pop jangle, 'Tina Weymouth' is the kind of driving, punchy, future pop that make This Many Boyfriends something special. <br /><br />With a wealth of praise from the music press under their belts, two BBC 6Music playlisted singles and radio sessions with Huw Stephens (Radio 1) and John Kennedy (Xfm), their recent UK tour saw them playing to packed out venues across the land. <br /><br />The band tour with Kaiser Chiefs in February.</p>
