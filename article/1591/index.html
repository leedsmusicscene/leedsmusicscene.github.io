        <h1>The Scaramanga Six recording new album with their latest drummer...</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2003.</p>
    <p>The Scaramanga Six have enlisted the services of a new drummer called Ant, or 'The Ponte-Carlo Kid' as he is widely known. Bizarrely, the man-cum-drumbeast can usually be found beating the skins in a top Queen tribute band - which is a slight improvement on the credentials naff-stakes of their last drummer who had a brief spell in Boney M! (no joke).<br><Br>Ant has already featured during a live set The Six did for the BBC recently and will be cutting his teeth live very soon with a couple of one-off gigs before Christmas. Ater the festive season, The Six intend to resume work on the new album and are planning a bit of a tour in Spring 2004.<br><br>You can hear a few snippets of new tracks from the as yet untitled album on the band's website.</p>
