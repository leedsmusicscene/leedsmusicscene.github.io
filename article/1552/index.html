    <p>HD1 Studios, now in its 18th year, has an enviable reputation for producing music from local acts to international selling artists.<br><br>To celebrate its 18th birthday, in partnership with acclaimed record label Uglyman Music, HD1 has embarked on a new initiative which has lead to the studio becoming the fulcrum of a more varied music company.  The partnership now provides artist development, professional management, publishing, and record releases.<br><br>The first local act to benefit from this initiative is Buen Chico, who arrived at HD1 via the highly acclaimed BSS Youth Music Project 'Ready2Burn'. Through the HD1/Uglyman partnership  the band  have already received interest from major record companies and publishers.  Plans are in place for a single release & UK tour in the new year.<br><br>The studio (formerly known as Beaumont Street)  has recently undergone a complete refurbishment, along with the installation of new equipment, including the Pro Tools HD2 digital recording system to compliment the best analogue facilities available.<br><br>The relaunched HD1 Studios has also enjoyed the return of Dave Creffield (originally produced Embrace's no 1 album 'The Good Will Out' at HD1) who is recording at  the studio in August 2003 with The Honeymoon Machine from Southampton, signed to Easy Street Records. Dave has also recently worked on songs for the soundtrack  to 'The Martix 2'.<br><br>Additionally international producer Howie B (U2, Bjork, Pavarotti, Simply Red, Soul II Soul) has  produced  songs for  up and coming local band, 'Jeepster' at the studio.<br><br>Also, the record label Crystal Songs  released the single, 'The First Word is the Hardest', by Leeds band Four Day Hombre in July.  The Hombre's recorded a series of tracks at HD1 Studios in 2002. The band has since supported bands such as  Oceansize  and The Coral and recognition from Radio 1 who playlisted the single after the band won a ten-day OneMusic unsigned competition. 'The first word is the hardest' entered the independent  charts at no 27.<br><br>Finally, HD1 will be promoting a new music showcase at the annual Music Industry Convention "In The City" in Manchester. The event takes place at Elemental on Oxford Street on Sunday 14th September from 8pm.  The showcase is promoted in conjunction with Logo Magazine - the UK's fastest growing music publication (circulation 250K). The night features performances from Leeds favourites Bodixa, Southampton's Fleeing New York, Cheltenham press darlings Silverman, and Essex boys Harmonium. Entrance is free.<br><br>For up to date news about the exciting changes taking place at HD1 studios please visit the new website www.hd1studios.com and register for regular news updates & special offers. </p>
