    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2013.</p>
    <p>Slam Dunk organisers have announced the remaining bands for the festival this coming May.<br /><br />UK post rock 6 piece Devil Sold His Soul make a return to Slam Dunk this year for only their 2nd ever performance at the festival.<br /><br />Unfortunately, The King Blues had to pull out of last year's Slam Dunk Festival, but this year organisers have secured the very first UK festival performance of the band's frontman, Itch. <br /><br />Joining Andrew McMahon (Something Corporate / Jacks Mannequin)  and Jonny Craig (Emarosa / Dance Gavin Dance) on the 'Solo' Stage lineup will be 7 others from the ska, pop punk, rock and indie rock worlds. William Beckett (The Academy Is) will be debuting his first solo UK show at Slam Dunk this year. <br /><br />Chas Palmer Williams of Lightyear fame will be there to hold the flag for Ska fans alike. With an already stellar ska punk lineup with legends King Prawn / Spunge he will be a welcome addition to this stage.<br /><br />Gavin Butler (The Blackout) will be there once again playing songs from his debut EP and maybe the odd Blackout track too.  Ace Enders (The Early November / I Can Make A Mess) who not only is the lead singer of The Early November but is a solo performer in his own right, releasing a number of solo albums under guises of 'I can Make a Mess (like Nobody's Business) and 'A Million Different People'. Expect to hear a selection from this talented artists back catalogue.<br /><br />Other additions include Class Of 92 (Matty from A Loss For Words), Sophomore (Alex From Decade) and Marc Halls (Hey Vanity).<br /><br />Slam Dunk Festival takes place at Leeds University on Saturday 25th May. Tickets are all sold out.</p>
