        <h1>DanMoFo - Dirty As Gin EP</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Dirty As Gin EP" recorded by DanMoFo. The review was written by Matthew Walton in 2005.</p>
    <p>As names for bands go, Test-Icicles must be the most absurd I have heard this year. A close second though is DanMoFo. Just can’t get my head around calling yourself Dan Mother Fuc**r.  You conjure an image of foul mouthed gangster rap, which this EP is far from.<br><br>But, as my old English teacher used to say, never judge a book by its cover, and this one definitely falls into that category. I inserted the CD with some trepidation, and was pleasantly surprised to hear the first track “Calm down”. No not a set of sound bites from Brookside, but a guitar driven, haunting tune that after listening to a few times really started to grow on me. It’s not a song that you will find yourself singing in the  shower,  but it is a good, interesting listen, and if played in the right ambience and to the right people it would be widely received.<br><br>I then proceeded to track 2, the EP entitled “Dirty as gin”.  The speed increases for this track, although the style remains the same. I have never found gin to be particularly dirty myself, so maybe I have missed out on something here but never mind. A little too repetitive this song and it lacks the creativity to make it leap out at you and demand to be bought, a bit like a Big Issue seller.<br><br>Moving on to “Oh no!”, and a change in direction, leading us to a slow piano influenced  song that is never going to get the party rocking, but is well crafted and somewhat haunting.<br><br>Last but by no means is least the ace in the pack “No I don’t”. I really liked this one. Good beat, good guitar and a more uplifting vocal performance. Reminded me of Beck in his earlier days, and that is a high compliment.<br><br>Overall this EP is recommended, but just make sure it’s your thing before you shell out some hard earned cash. If you can imagine a mix of Portishead, Radiohead and Beck then you won’t be far wrong. It would not appeal to everyone, but those who enjoy a chilled out, vocal tune with guitar and piano influences, I think will enjoy it.<br><br>A good effort from an expanding and increasingly high quality Leeds music scene.</p>
