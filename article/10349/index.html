    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2009.</p>
    <p>The first release of 2009 for local label Bad Sneakers Records is from brand new Leeds act, The 39Steps. Their debut single, ‘Coming Clean’, is released on the 16th February as a Digital Download. The single will be followed by the band’s debut album, also titled ‘Coming Clean’ and due for release in March.<br><br>The 39Steps is a project from producer, musician and DJ Kato. In an album written and recorded over a period of 2 years, the Leeds-based producer has created a place where hip hop, psychedelia, jazz, and filmscores collide. Built to a blueprint of bottom-heavy beats and guest singer Laura Fowles' spine-tingling vocals, this debut showcases Kato’s manifesto of thoughtful and emotive music.<br><br>The 39Steps are set to be another success for the Bad Sneakers Records label, who were the original home of Wild Beasts. Their roster includes Tigers That Talked, The Rosie Taylor Project, The Old Romantic Killer Band, Middleman, and The Sugars (amongst others).<br><br>You can watch the video for the single ‘Coming Clean’ at www.vimeo.com.</p>
