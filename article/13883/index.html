    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for Northern Torch.</p>
    <p>After a solo artist on the hunt for musicians and an up and coming band splitting up, Northern Torch was formed in early August 2010.<br /><br />After getting into the final 60 outta 10,000 competitors of the Live and Unsigned Competition and playing in venues like Sheffield City Hall, and The Willows Centre, Manchester, to name a few, Brett Lee and his manager Shirley Leeks decided it was time to bolster the song writing and solo music by putting a band together.<br /><br />After searching around for session musicians and having no luck, the ball starting rolling when a band named Apollo's Basement broke up due to band members going to Uni.<br /><br />Apollo's Basement band members Stef (bass) and Tom (guitar) had recently joined the band and had played gigs with them in Hi-Fi Club, The Cockpit, Elbow Room, The Box, etc and were up for the challenge of working on a new project. Stef also works as a sound engineer with Ken at The Box, who was more then up for the challenge and was keen to play drums in the band.<br /><br />After a few jams .. the rest is history in the making!!!<br /><br />Band members:<br /><br />Brett Lee (keys,vocals)<br />Tom Grant (guitar)<br />Stefan Wisniewski (bass) <br />Ken Bebb (drums).</p>
