    <p>Independent Venue Week is promoting gigs all over the county and Leeds is hosting 2 gigs this weekend 29th and 30th January at 360 Club Leeds. <br /> <br />Leeds based 360 Club is renowned for its support of unsigned acts, showcasing the best Yorkshire has to offer and champion new and exciting emerging artists, discovering such acts as Alt-J and Allusondrugs.  However, 360 Club, is not just an opportunity for bands to get their music heard in a great venue, Richard Watson (360Club Owner) offers the artists invaluable advice and support. <br /> <br />Doors for both gigs is 8pm to 11.30pm and tickets are Â£5 Adv from Jumbo Records & Crash Records.<br /><br />Friday 29th January you can see Happy Daggers with their funky, soulful indie beats, alongside Marsicans, upbeat indie meets dirty pop and Leeds Music Scene favourites. Marsicans are real crowd pleasers and know how to get a crowd up and dancing.  Then you can wallow in the tropical pop of The Seagulls before Meihaus compete an indie pop fuelled line up.<br /><br />Saturday 30th January you can see the incredible Fold, who are and experimental Leeds based quartet who never fail to entertain with a compelling projected set of visuals.  Also playing are Ceiling Demons, whose ability to capture the rawness of human emotion in their words & rhymes have gained radio support from the likes of XFM & BBC 6 Music. The beautifully crafted sounds of Rawschac, with impressive instrumental performances, combine hip hop with grunge and soul, and rounding off a night full of beats laden hip-hop, are the bass heavy, electronic infused four-piece Terra-ist.<br />  <br /><iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2059885891/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless>Two Past Midnight (Single) by Fold</iframe></p>
