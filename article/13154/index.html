        <h1>Dinosaur Pile-up - Birds and Planes</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Birds and Planes" recorded by Dinosaur Pile-up. The review was written by Daniel Pearson in 2010.</p>
    <p>The eagerly awaited lead-off single from Dinosaur Pile-up's debut album 'Growing Pains' certainly doesn't waste time - an immediate vocal line and scratchy power chords kick straight into a persistent chorus, then heads into some pounding punk riffage all within the first 40 seconds of the song.<br /><br />With two new members on board and with two years of touring and single releases under their belts, the band have consolidated a winning formula of nagging pop hooks and Grohl-esque powerhouse drums. As on previous singles (like the fantastic 'My Rock n' Roll,' their early calling card and standout song to date) James Kenosha's excellent production lends their muscular pop-punk a polished and radio-friendly sheen without diluting its core energy and bite. Matt Biglands' talent for crafting insistent pop melodies and grunge riffs is impressive (and he also displays some serious chops as a rock musician, playing all the instruments on this song,) but there is nothing here that can't be found in the iPod libraries of anyone with even a passing interest in early 90s US alternative rock. The debts to early Weezer and Nirvana are obvious ones, and as yet the band haven't fully imprinted their own identity into the mix. Despite this, Dinosaur Pile-up's marriage of goofball slacker sensibility and anthemic punk is an engaging one. 'Birds and Planes' is a buzzy, eager-to-please summer song that will win them lots of new fans and bodes well for their upcoming debut.</p>
