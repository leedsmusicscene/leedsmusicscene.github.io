    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2013.</p>
    <p>Leeds Music Scene has this month appointed a new Editor, Katriona Gilmour, who replaces Dave Sugden after 14 years in the role.<br /><br />Leeds Music Scene began life online in 1998 as a resource for bands in the West Yorkshire area, over 3,000 of which have current profiles on the site, and it is a credit to the hundreds of contributors over the years that it remains a popular and informative source for everyone involved in the local music scene.<br /><br />Dave Sugden said, "The time was right to allow Leeds Music Scene to be pushed in new directions, to take it to the next level with ideas and a fresh, current vision, while continuing to support the local grassroots music scene in the city, its bands, venues, studios, promoters and all those that play a role in making Leeds such a vibrant city for music".<br /><br />"I welcome Katriona and wish her all the very best as Editor. I am confident that Katriona will succeed in the role, for which she has already shown abundant enthusiasm and will soon make her mark on LMS as she brings her vision to the community website". <br /><br />Katriona said, "I have always been passionate about music and the wide ranging talent we have right here in Leeds.  We are lucky to have one of the most vibrant musical communities and i am so excited to be a part of it.  LMS gives me the opportunity to tell everyone about our brilliant local bands and the great gigs we have at some amazing venues across the city.  <br /><br />Having been an active writer on LMS for over a year, I am excited for the opportunity, as Editor, to develop our site and bring it to a wider readership.  I hope the new features like 'LMS is listening to...', and competitions will be the start of bigger things for us.  <br /><br />Keep a look out for our next competition, this is one not to be missed!"<br /><br />On behalf of the team at Leeds Music Scene, we all wish Katriona all the very best in her new role and hope all bands, musicians, new and existing writers, and music fans give her their support as she takes over the editorial duties.<br /><br />Anyone with ideas for features for the site, wishes to write for the site, or is in a band that would like to discuss coverage, please get in touch with Katriona online or at a gig in the city.<br /><br />Katriona can be contacted directly via editor [ at ] leedsmusicscene.net.<br /><br />Katriona tweets from @kmgkaptivation.</p>
