    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for Diehards Divide.</p>
    <p>Diehards Divide was formed in early 2010 with the whole intention of making powerful, yet melodic metal in the style of old school favourites such as Maiden, Priest, Metallica and Megadeth. After Spruce and Stu had worked together in 80s hair rock band Karma Slave, they felt that a change in direction was necessary for them and as a result formed Diehards Divide.<br /><br />Yaan McIntosh was added to the line-up as frontman, in the stylings of Blaze Bayley with the hair and vocals to match! Neil "Bucky O" Hare joined as lead shredder, so masterful on guitar that Joe Satriani himself would look like he had ten thumbs, and the legendary "ace of the bass" Carl Riot joined the fold in September 2010.<br /><br />To date the lads are building up their reputation by playing gigs within local Leeds venues, delivering explosive and energetic performance every time.  They have completed their first single "Control" which is available at request and are now currently working on their first album which is yet to be titled.<br /><br />BAND MEMBERS:<br /><br />Yaan - Vocals<br />Neil - Lead Guitars<br />Spruce - Rhythm Guitars<br />Carl Riot - Bass<br />Stixxx - Drums.</p>
