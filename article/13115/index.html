    <p>Yorkshire radio station Ridings FM is extending its work to support up-and-coming musicians in the local area.<br /><br />Ridings FM broadcasts on 106.8 FM and was launched in 1999. The station covers Wakefield and the surrounding area, including Castleford, Pontefract, Featherstone, Normanton and Knottingley.<br /><br />Alongside its local news, travel updates, and entertainment services, it has for several years now run a Local Music Update on Thursday evenings, hosted by Andy Philpott, featuring a gig guide and song by an unsigned band or artist from the area.<br /><br />However, the slot - 9.45pm on a Thursday night - has proved troublesome for some music fans, as they'd often be out at a gig or otherwise busy.<br /><br />But new technology has provided the solution. The weekly update is now streamed on the Ridings FM website as a podcast, updated every weekend.<br /><br />It still has the gig guide for the forthcoming week, and still has a fresh unheard song in every edition, but the podcast format allows listeners to download and hear it in their own time, not restricted to a particular time on a Thursday night.<br /><br />Ridings FM Programme Manager James Marriott said: "We're committed to supporting the local music and helping new talent come through, and this is the next step in that. <br /><br />"On-air, Andy will be popping up during the week with details of what's in the podcast, which listeners can then download at their leisure.<br /><br />"We're always looking at how we can play a greater role in our community and this seemed like an excellent step forward."<br /><br />To download the podcast, just go to www.ridingsfm.co.uk and then click on Local Music Update on the Music drop down menu.<br /><br />Any solo artists, duos or bands who would like to be featured on the Local Music Update should send material and information to:<br /><br />Andy Philpott, Local Music Update<br />106.8 Ridings FM<br />Unit 7 Network Centre<br />Zenith Park<br />Whaley Road<br />Barnsley<br />S75 1HT<br /><br />Alternatively, you can e-mail andy [ at ] themusiccollective.co.uk.</p>
