    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for The Idol Dead.</p>
    <p>Polly Phluid - The Voice<br />Tim - The Squeal<br />Nish - The Beat<br />KC - The Scratch<br />Dan - The Rumble<br /><br />Ok, how does one go about writing a bio for a rock n roll band without either sounding like an aspiring journo hopped up on sugary drinks spoutin' hyperbole like some demented PR machine or resorting to tired clich√©s and delusional fantasy? <br /><br />Well, let's try honesty.<br /><br />When Tim Jeffs saw Polly Phluid bounding about on a festival stage with his former band, Phluid, he thought 'I'd like to be in a band with him one day' ... and, never a man to miss an opportunity, a few years later he got the chance and invited Polly for a jam.<br /><br />That Jam included Tim's mate Nish on drums - the three fellas got along like a house party aflame and before long some pretty cool tunes were stomping round the room demanding attention. <br /><br />Best form a band then ... and they did. . <br /><br />Miguel Luque landed in Leeds to study music less than a month later and, spotting and ad in shop, applied for the bass player job. <br /><br />He was the only applicant - and was absolutely perfect.<br /><br />Polly struggled on as singer/rhythm guitarist until KC Duggan came screaming into the fray throwing big chords and razor-sharp cheekbones around the place. <br /><br />This is when that 'band magic' happened and these 5 lads thought they were really on to something.<br /> <br />They were right - The Idol Dead became a ten legged, riff-hungry entertainment machine - with songs catchier than Ebola and melodies sweeter than sugar-dipped strawberries. <br /><br />Tours were booked, pics taken and an album recorded - The Idol Dead were getting' good reviews and building up a fan base.<br /><br />They played festivals, jetted off to Barcelona to play for Miguel's home crowd and even supported a few of their heroes.   <br /><br />However, all things come to and end - Mig was accepted to study Jazz in London and reluctantly left the fray - but not before the Idol's visited a tattooist and scarred their rock n roll identity on their bodies forever.  <br /><br />The Idols were gutted, they were happy that their friend was following his dream, but how were they gonna keep this shit real and carry on ...<br /><br />... step up to the plate Dan Sugden. <br />He couldn't have been more different from Miguel - a tee-total, man-mountain hewn from the very rock of Calderdale, but he fitted in perfectly and before long had an 'IDOL' scar of his own.<br /><br />Now, with Miguel riding shot-gun in spirit, and Dan hammering the rumblehammer for all it's worth The Idol Dead are looking into a bright new future and planning the rock assault of the decade ... keep your eyes on these boys, they'd love to rock your world..</p>
