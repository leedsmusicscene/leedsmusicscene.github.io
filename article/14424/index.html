    <p>Leeds Town Hall will welcome back the Leeds University Union Music Society (LUUMS) in association with Artforms on Sunday 20th March for its annual charity concert.<br /><br />This prestigious concert is one of the highlights of the LUUMS Concert Series, enabling performers from within the society to give something back to the community and raise money for a charitable cause, which this year is Leeds Children's Charity.<br /> <br />This is the first time that the annual concert has featured pupils from local secondary schools performing with LUUMS Symphony Orchestra, Symphonic Wind Orchestra, Choir and Chamber Choir. The programme will include an exciting finale involving all performers as well as John Adams Short Ride in a Fast Machine, Samuel Hazo Rush and Holst's Mars, Jupiter and Neptune from The Planets.<br /> <br />Proceeds from this concert will go to Leeds Children's Charity who support children suffering from poverty, neglect, abuse, learning difficulties, illness, or who are themselves young carers. They do this by sending 350 children each year, between the ages of 7-11, to their holiday centre in Silverdale on the border of Lancashire and Cumbria. <br /> <br />LUUMS was founded in 1926 and has been running for over 80 years as one of the biggest university societies in England. There are around 600 members and eight ensembles, all of which perform two or more concerts throughout the year. The LUUMS Symphony Orchestra is a fully auditioned ensemble with around 80 players who meet weekly to perform to the highest of standards. The Orchestra tours at the end of each year and recent destinations have included the Black Forest, Barcelona, Poland, Tuscany and France.<br /> <br />Tickets for this fundraiser are priced from £5 to £15. To book, call the Box Office on 0113 224 3801 or visit www.leedsconcertseason.com.</p>
