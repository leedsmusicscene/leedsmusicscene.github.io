    <p>JONNY: vocals+acoustic guitar.<br />SOPHIE: trumpet+vocals<br />JON: lead guitar+vocals<br />SAM: keyboard <br />NICK: bass<br />SHAKEY: drums<br /><br />The Rosie Taylor Project came together in a redbrick Victorian shambles in Leeds. A modest beginning, with practices spent squished into a small living room, things soon took on a more disciplined hue when, after a handful of gigs, they signed to Bad Sneakers Records.<br /><br />A debut single, 'Black and White Films' swiftly followed, the video for which featured regularly on MTV2 and benefitted from radio play on 6 Music, XFM, and KCRW in the US. In the meantime, live shows included appearances with Camera Obscura, Midlake, Jens Lekman and Jeffrey Lewis to name but a few. Marc Riley has also kindly hosted the band on his 6 Music show for a number of live sessions.<br /><br />Amidst all of this a debut album was recorded in Richard Formby's (Wild Beasts, Herman Dune) attic studio. Many kind words were written about this record from the likes of Drowned in Sound and This is Fake DIY. One critic described it as 'a craft sounding like Nick Drake in romantic company, stopping over for a week at Stuart Staples' French cottage with a shitload of wine', which is a neat little summary.<br /><br />Having recently returned to the studio with the aforementioned invaluable Richard Formby a second album 'Twin Beds' has emerged, and new single 'Sleep' will be self-released on 13 June.</p>
