        <h1>Vib Gyor - Insomnia EP</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Insomnia EP" recorded by Vib Gyor. The review was written by Sam Saunders in 2004.</p>
    <p>Violet, Indigo, Blue: Green, Yellow, Orange, Red. The colours of a rainbow when you stand on your head.<Br><BR>It sometimes seems that the best new bands just appear fully formed, out of nowhere, on a rainy day in the Spring. The truth is that some bands are just a bit more talented and a bit more patient than your average victim of guitar passion. Vib Gyor seem to be in that mould.<Br><BR>This stuff is not hurled together. This is a monster of a demo. We have three killer songs, a real quality voice and a band with a million ideas and the nouse to make them work for a potentially big audience.<Br><BR>The production sounds American, the musical ideas are mostly European. You could imagine any of the epic guitar and synth bands of the last 5 years, but never confuse Vib Gyor with any one of them. Neither Doves nor Muse. Not Radiohead, definitely not Coldplay or Sigur Ros. But each of those is a relevant comparison. Vib Gyor have got a mysterious name, but they're not reaching out to the fashionistas, and they’re not slumming it with your Havens or Starsailors neither. What they have to offer seems to have a wider and longer reach.<Br><BR>The most obvious feature is David Fendick's exceptional voice. It takes no prisoners. Whether he's soaring around a chorus like Jeff Buckley ("Permanent Disguise") or doing the husky narrator on a verse like Chris Martin with hormones ("You Wear Me Out") he never runs out of road and never stretches to get towards a note. He hits it and holds it with enough breath and variation to stay there for the rest of the week if needed. Don’t worry, it still sounds personal, confiding and special.<Br><BR>Each of the three songs uses the same basic idea. The singer/guitarist is centre stage with a bursting heart and a tousled melodic gift for emotional connection. Up alongside, there's a four man band - Zane Keenan, Jonny Hooker, Jonny Mulroy and James Hepster providing a great singing orchestra of sound with big chords and deft touches of atmospheric guitar, keyboards and sundry effects. Bass and drums have the American-import richness that makes the demo sound like a "real recording". Everyone is playing music. No one is playing an instrument.<Br><BR>Vib Gyor. Standing the rainbow on its head. Not a bad name, then.</p>
