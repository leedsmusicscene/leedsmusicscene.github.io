        <h1>The Lost 45s UK - The Next Projected Sound Of...</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "The Next Projected Sound Of..." recorded by The Lost 45s UK. The review was written by Campbell McNeill in 2007.</p>
    <p>The Lost 45s UK are famous for being a band that supported The Who but this EP shows that The Lost 45s UK are much more than being just a support band. The release comes at a perfect time with a mod revival in the mainstream.<br><br>Grandfather mod, Ray Davies has released an album, The Who are on the telly and the mod revival sound heard in bands such as ‘big in Japan’ The Ordinary Boys and the Chelsea Dagger of The Fratellis shows that now is a good time to know how to tune a Vespa.<br><br>This 4 track EP is pure pop brilliance but its limited double 7 inch release from the bands website is wasted on people like me with no record player.<br><br>God Given is summers eating ice cream at the nice bit of the beach at Bridlington; Psychotic Rhythm and Blues with its, ‘my brain is running wild again, I‘m all mixed up inside again’ lyric is a soundtrack for a serial killer, pure Helter Skelter.<br><br>Take Your Time has a chorus that won’t leave your head and is a song that would easily fit in a pop chart of today; Ghost in the Noonday Sun has a more relaxed sexy feel, evoking the sound of the Style Council.<br><br>This EP is filled with harmonious melodies with the drive of pure Atlantic soul.  A wall of sound production and CD release would make the whole thing bigger and would surely guarantee some radio play. This band should get out from the mod scene to an audience who don’t have record players but recognise a good tune when they hear one.</p>
