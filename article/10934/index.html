        <h1>Rebel Yell - Live</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Live" recorded by Rebel Yell. The review was written by Danielle Millea in 2009.</p>
    <p>From the first notes of 'My Primrose' it's easy to hear that Rebel Yell are a highly talented band. And to top that they are from Leeds, as the first track sounds like it's about a little known pub down Meanwood way... Instantly it reminds me of 50s rockabilly, but with a more punk twist. This was recorded at Shepherds Bush Empire.<br /><br /> 'Lost A Blue' is a fast-paced track about losing a love, 'Tumbling Down' has a more country feel to it, but the content is just as hard hitting (drugs) as the next track 'A Dangerous Word,' about the perils of relationships, sounding like a collaboration between Buddy Holly and Bruce Springsteen. The end line is especially catchy, "I'll start a riot of my own / I heard him say" giving visions of one of their heroes, The Clash.<br /><br />Back to the rockabilly with the comical 'Tomorrow's Fish And Chip Wrapper' (though lads, the health and safety brigade have banned this as a meal wrapper, silly sods.) 'La La' is about a cool school friend forever in bother and not ratting on him. The punky 'Bang Bang I'm Famous' is pretty self explanatory; what would you do if you found a gun and was close to the edge? Talk of more deadly weapons finishes off the album (these guys are nice as pie, it must be the rockabilly talking!) 'Glasses, Knives And Bottles,' with its outstanding line "Someone's lost a soulmate to the guns of modern life," looks at the rise in knife crime with its creeping beat.<br /><br />Now I only have one complaint with this release. Having seen the band live several times and hearing other people's testimonies that the band are excellent, this should have been a live DVD more than a live CD. The lovely looking bunch of guys, topped off with sheer musical talent on stage, and of course the standing drummer and double bass climbing, adds so much to this band, so next time let us see the show too!</p>
