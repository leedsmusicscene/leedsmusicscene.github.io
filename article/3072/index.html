    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for Area 39.</p>
    <p>Started playing bass guitar when I was about 17 and in the 2 / 3 years that followed I switched between bass and 6 string guitar a good few times, after a while I settled on bass and in 1995 I helped form the first band I was in "Area 39".<bR><br>The first Area 39 only lasted a year or so then we went our separate ways but I decided there and then that if I was to do any music in the future I was going to do it under the banner Area 39.<bR><bR>I went on to join "Cosmic" in 1997 and they turned out to be a very good Brit Pop band, after playing the Leeds, West Yorkshire circuit for 8 or 9 months and after my first taste of being in a studio recording a demo I quit to look for a band who played more "experimental" music.<br><br>Over the next few years I had tons of auditions for bands in the north of England but non of them wrote the type of music I wanted to play, then in 2000 I helped a local singer songwriter record an album "One Step" by "Saint Walks To The River" which is available on "Peoplesound".<bR><br>2002 brought "Overplay" a band from Halifax but yet again I quit after only a few months, again to look for someone that was doing something with a bit of a difference.<br><br>In 2003 at the age of 29, I came full circle and the real Area 39 was born. I found the right  the studio and recorded the album I had been working on for the past few years..</p>
