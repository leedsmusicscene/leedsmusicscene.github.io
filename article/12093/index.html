        <h1>Leeds Music Scene launch Facebook application for Leeds gigs</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2010.</p>
    <p>Leeds Music Scene have this week released the first version of their new Facebook application and are inviting visitors to the site to add the application and to feed back comments or ideas.<br /><br />The application allows visitors to either Leeds Music Scene, or to Facebook, to search for gigs taking place in Leeds and to announce if they are attending the gig. Users can also invite their Facebook friends and see who else is planning on going.<br /><br />The application will also allow you to see which gigs your friends are going to. Finally, in the first version a user can also add the application to their profile enabling them to list all the Leeds gigs they plan to attend.<br /><br />The application is currently in its infancy and will be developed further over the next few weeks. We hope to have a fully functional LMS and Facebook integration in 2010.<br /><br />If you would like to show your support for this work please add the LMS Facebook Application and use it today - we'd welcome your comments! Users are requested to send in comments (good or bad) via the Facebook application wall or directly to us here.<br /><br />For those of you not on Facebook, we have recently developed a gig listings gadget for your iGoogle homepage - or for embedding on your website - which you can read more about at the Leeds Gig Guide Google Gadget page.</p>
