    <p>Brit legends The Zombies - fresh from their triumphant Glastonbury performance - announce a brand new studio album and UK tour.<br /> <br />It's been a highly productive past 18 months or so for influential musical icons The Zombies. Led by founder members Rod Argent and Colin Blunstone, The Zombies have completed a raft of shows across the US including a second appearance at SXSW festival.  They have seen their enduring classic 'Time of The Season' sampled by Eminem ('Rhyme Or Reason') and received a nomination for the Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame.  In addition to this, they have completed a brand new studio album, produced by Chris Potter (The Verve, Urban Hymns), followed up by rocking a new music showcase at The Great Escape in Brighton this year and created something really special with their live performance at this year's Glastonbury. <br /> <br />Despite originally disbanding in 1967, the band officially reformed in 2004, The Zombies have always found their music in demand from subsequent generations. Their songs have been used in numerous films, television series and global advertising campaigns. From the hugely popular Mad Men through to last year's Chanel campaign for Coco Mademoiselle, featuring Kiera Knightley and their music is quite simply timeless.<br /> <br />The Zombies latest release, 'Still Got That Hunger', has all the elements of an enduring rock opera, sitting as comfortably in the present day as it would have in the swinging decades of Aquarius. Opening the show with 'Moving On', Colin flexes his undeniably impressive vocal range before moving into 'Chasing The Past', a perfectly crafted piece of art, that leaves no doubt as to the band's superb musicianship. A real showstopper comes up next with "Edge Of The Rainbow', followed by the uptempo 1970's Americana track 'New York', before dropping down to some blues and jazz-fuelled melodies with a re-make of their 1965 single 'I Want You Back Again' and a joyous choral reminisce, blended with classic rock guitar riffs on 'And We Were Young Again'. Rod's on form on keys in 'Maybe Tomorrow', a cheeky, charismatic number, followed by the Blunstone-penned 'Now I Know I'll Never Get Over You', a radio-friendly classic that's destined to be on everyone's playlists. The quiet piano/voice duet 'Little One' comes next, before the final epic, euphoric concerto 'Beyond The Borderline' to complete this timeless musical journey.  <br /><br />The artwork for the new album has been created by Terry Quirk, the original artist of their iconic album 'Odessey and Oracle', hailed by Rolling Stone Magazine and NME earlier this year as one of the greatest albums of all time.<br /><br />The Zombies will play Brudenell Social Club in Leeds on December 7th 2015.</p>
