    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for Eyes Of March.</p>
    <p>Eyes Of March are 4 best friends from Wakefield.<br /><br />Eyes Of March have created a sound that combines rock influences both old and new. Heavyily influenced by bands such as Them Crooked Vultures, Led Zeppelin and Biffy Clyro.<br /><br />In 2009, Eyes Of March gigged the local scene constantly gaining valuable experiance along the way with the aid of support slots with local and national well known bands such as Templeton Pek, Adam Bomb, Steroid Freak Pussy and Inamba.<br /><br />Eyes Of March have always been complimented on the pure energy and passion given whislt playing live sometimes resulting in head injuries, flooded stages and mosh pits a plenty.<br /><br />2009 also saw the release of their first demo EP "Disaster" as this was never properly produced and distributed it just supplied the people with a small taste of what Eyes Of March are about.<br /><br />2010 will see Eyes Of March pushing themselves more and more in terms of writing, recording and performing. It will see the production of their first real EP which is being recorded and mixed by Eyes Of March themselves!<br /><br />On Saturday 15th May 2010 Eyes Of March opened the Diamond Studios Stage at the first ever Wakefield Rock Festival, sharing the bill with big names such as Pitchshifter, InMe, Senser, Panic Cell, Heavens Basement and more!<br /><br />With hard graft, blood, sweat and maybe abit of luck Eyes Of March will go far this year. All they ask for is your support and love!.</p>
