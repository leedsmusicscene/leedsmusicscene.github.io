    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for Brooders.</p>
    <p>Brooders, originally from Nottingham and now living in Leeds, is a Psych-Grunge Trio formed of Adam Bairstow (Guitar/Vocals) and Liam Naylor (Drums) and Adam Speare (Bass). <br /> <br />Formed in Leeds in October 2014 under the original name 'Hunny' as a duo, and in February 2016 recruited a bassy southener to join their ranks under the new name 'Brooders'.<br /><br />Following the Release of three successful singles Brooders have released their debut 'Hunny EP' on the 4th February to a sold out audience, and are currently back on the road playing scattered, sporadic and exciting shows up and down the country.<br /><br />During their time as a band Brooders have played a range of shows with likes of God Damn, I Divide, Crosa Rosa, Fizzy Blood and Little May. Having been played a number of times nationally on radio stations such as BBC Nottingham, BBC Yorkshire, Leeds Student Radio, Brooders are now looking to step up their game and bring their music to the ears and eyes of the underground.<br /><br />The kicking and screaming Trio from Nottingham Derby and London, now based in Leeds, Brooders are here to stay. The name being an English variation of the German word for brothers, the ties of Brooders couldn't be closer. With exciting raucous live shows and an audience raring for more, the future couldn't be louder for Brooders..</p>
