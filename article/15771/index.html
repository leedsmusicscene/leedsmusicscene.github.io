    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for Vanilla Gorillaz.</p>
    <p>Band Members<br />Carl Wallis - Vocals & Bass<br />Steve Whyte - Guitar & Synth<br />Rob Marsden - Drums<br /><br />Vanilla Gorillaz are an alternative rock/electronic pop trio from Leeds who are rapidly gaining recognition with their Anthemic sound combining Rock and pop with elements of Electronic Dance to create a powerful unique yet relatable sound. Recently they supported chart-toppers 'The Human League' and 'The Christians' in Preston with plans of more big names to follow..<br /><br />The band consists of Carl Wallis on vocals & bass, Steve Whyte on guitar & Synth and Rob Marsden on Drums. <br />Steve and Carl met at Leeds college of music whilst studying on a popular music degree course and recruited Rob through an advert placed on Star now. They have found the formula of working as a three piece hugely enjoyable and has been a massive influence on how the sound of the band has developed both live and in the studio. Even though they are all from different parts of the U.K, Vanilla Gorillaz regard Leeds their hometown as this is where they rehearse and record.  <br /><br />So far they have released five successful singles and three music videos, two of which were through Longevity Records which have received near to 75,000 plays combined. Their most recent video "Fame and Fortune" was a collaborative effort with Hip Hop super group Sovereignty from Trinidad & Tobago.<br /><br />In 2013, VGz worked with chart topping sensation Redd who had two #1 Hit singles ''I'm Daydreaming" with Snoop Dogg & Akon - "Bedroom" with Pitbull & Qwote. Further collaborations took place in 2014 on the track "One life" (release date TBC) with Redd & Sovereignty, produced by Anson Soverall.<br /><br />The Band known to their fans as "VGz" are currently recording their debut album set to be released later in 2015 with singles and videos being released along the way. <br /><br />Vanilla Gorillaz have remained number 1 for seven consecutive months in the Reverbnation Dance Charts for Leeds and have ranked number 8 in the U.K. They hope to get their National Rank to number 1 after their debut album release in 2015.<br /><br />With big things on the way, like, follow and subscribe for updates!.</p>
