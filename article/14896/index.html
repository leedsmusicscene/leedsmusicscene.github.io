    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for NEVE.</p>
    <p>''Comprising the beat of the marching drum with a whirlwind of vocals, NEVE are Leeds' freshest duo, ready to take on the world one beat at a time. Drawing comparisons alongside artists such as Fleetwood Mac and Adele, this duo create a such an alive atmosphere, you will inevitabley find your self singing along and begging for more.''<br /><br /><br />Neve were founded out of a mutual love for music. Niamh Hanlon and Alister Roberts have brought together a mash up of a wide range of musical influences; from the likes of Jessie J to Fleetwood Mac. <br /><br />Their stripped down sound allows each of them to shine in their own right, without too many distractions. With Niamh's husky melodies and Alister's thumping rhythms they really are a force to be reckoned with. <br /><br />The pair have recently been involved in the competition Centre Stage - where they managed to secure a finalist position which led them to perform at the O2 Academy. The Centre Stage competition was aiming to raise money for Martin House Children's Hospice, while also giving young people a chance to perform to a large audience with the winner going on to perform at Leeds Festival. Neve put on a stellar performance and although they didn't go on to win, the competition has given them invaluble experiences which they will use as they think to the future.<br /><br />With the launch of thier Debut E.P at the end of this summer, there are sure to be exciting times ahead for the duo. Keep an ear to ground for more on Neve.  - Laura Anderson<br /><br /><br />For more information/bookings, please contact:  neve-band@hotmail.co.uk<br />and follow them on twitter @ twitter.com/neveofficial.</p>
