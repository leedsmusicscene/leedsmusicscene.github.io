    <p>A new sound, a new name, a new look, and a new approach. Funky Soul-Jazz singer/songwriter Sarah Brickel is 2011's answer to the modern musician. No budget, no big label, just great songs and a passion to get it to her fans. <br /><br />Sarah explains, "The music industry has changed. We have got to do it for ourselves and our fans nowadays. We don't need a label to back us. I just want to get my music to the people that love it." <br /><br />Out of necessity and a drive to move forwards Sarah and husband Tim Brickel started making their own studio and began recording tracks in 2008. "All we had was garageband and a couple of mics out in the shed. Ridiculous really but what we achieved was nothing less than a miracle." At the time Sarah had just signed her first record deal but things were not going to plan. Sarah says, "Everything ground to a halt and I wasn't happy to just sit and wait for someone else to make things happen." Eventually her debut 'You give me something' (Sarah Mitchell) was released in April 2009. The album including half of the tracks they recorded in their very own shed. Sarah also featured on a virgin compilation album alongside big names such as fellow northerner Corrine Bailey Ray, Lilly Allen and Frank Sinatra. <br /><br />However in 2010 Sarah made the decision to leave her former label in order to move forward with her career. "Nothing was happening! After three years it was time to move on." However instead of trying to find another record label to take her on Sarah decided on a new route. "I have learnt the hard way. If you want something doing then you have to do it yourself. I have an amazing band and I believe that we will get there in the end." <br /><br />Sarah's forthcoming album release 'Music Box' is self funded, produced, promoted and self managed on a shoe string budget. However the results are amazing. "I truly believe that if I can get my songs heard that we will be very successful. This is where the hard work begins." The album was recorded in their own studio now known as 19b studio records. Sarah says "I have rebranded myself and my music has taken a slightly more modern approach to soul and jazz. Most of the songs are my originals. The album has a great sound and encompasses the music that I love with some quirky suprises. It's very exciting and I can't wait for the fans to hear it. They have been waiting a long time for this." Sarah Brickel's new album 'Music Box' will be available to buy at the end of 2011.</p>
