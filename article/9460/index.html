        <h1>Jonjo Feather - I Suppose</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "I Suppose" recorded by Jonjo Feather. The review was written by Ben Partridge in 2008.</p>
    <p>It’s hard to put a finger on it, but whatever <i>it</i> is, Jonjo Feather has it, and he’s got it in spades. Whether it’s because he looks and sounds like he could be the test-tube baby offspring of a great orgiastic love-in involving David Bowie and Lou Reed is mere conjecture, but in this quick and to the point debut single of scuzzbucket, sensuous fuzz-rock, he bristles with the salacious bravado only a true performer can pull off.<br><br>‘I Suppose’ has a Queens of the Stone Age-esque sultry swagger, with as much grit as there is glam. It’s a laconic, lascivious drawl of a song, undulating along atop the tub-thump of minimal, yet purposive drums. The half-whispered, hot-as-buffed-leather vocals perfectly capture the voluptuous feline prowl, the salacious onstage stalk that Jonjo possesses. The part-pouting, part-phone breathing chorus is so dangerously attractive, so darkly predatory and seductively rapine, it could be classed as criminal.<br><br>The wavering, wily riff, slides supine and drowsy up and down the fret board, with such effortless, languid cool, the guitar becomes almost soporifically soothing; Jonjo the somnolent snake charmer. This is especially the case in B-side ‘Face By Your Window’, which is a much more expansive, delicate affair, more a speculative saunter than a prancing strut. Fragile guitars and tactful swells of cymbal create a deeply expressive, placid reverie. The characteristically sibilant vocal murmur features here too, but as a soft and mournful half-sigh, which suits the reflective atmosphere of the track exceptionally well.<br><br>This release showcases two contrasting aspects of an utterly distinctive new talent, offering two complementary sides of a rare and unique coin, the value of which may be too premature to estimate. But the immeasurable excitement of such a sensational prospect as Jonjo Feather is all the more thrilling for it. Fantastic stuff.</p>
