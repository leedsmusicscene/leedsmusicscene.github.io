    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2008.</p>
    <p>Kinch, a young indie-pop band from the Halton area of Leeds, has just been signed by London-based indie label Halo UK and expect their first single, the double A-side 'Old Fashioned Love' / 'Everybody's Talking About It', to be released in July.<br><br>Enjoying the fruits of a rejuvenated live scene in Yorkshire, Kinch's profile has been on the rise in recent months. The band was named amongst the winners of the Leeds Bright Young Things 2008, a competition that counts Corrine Bailey Rae and The Music as previous winners. They then filmed a live session for the BBC in January and were featured on BBC1â€™s Look North as potentially the "next big thing" to come out of the region, following the international success of the Kaiser Chiefs and Arctic Monkeys. ITV have since picked up their music and Kinch songs have featured in Emmerdale and other shows. The band itself will make a guest appearance on new ITV primetime series Houseguest next month.<br><br>All of the above is helping to boost interest in Kinch's live performances, a source of some pride for the band. Following recent gigs at Leeds' Cockpit and Faversham last month, over a hundred fans followed the band over the Pennines for their second appearance at Liverpool's Cavern Club.<br><br>The band recorded their single at Touchwood Studios in Leeds. They were keen to work again with producer Bruce Wood, whose previous credits include The Clash, Nightmares on Wax and more recently The Cribs. Bruce had engineered an earlier Kinch session as part of the Bright Young Things competition.<br><br>More festival dates and a UK tour are now in the planning stages for late summer. Kinch play at The Library on Sunday May 18th.</p>
