    <p>With immediate effect BBC Radio Leeds has decided to cease broadcasting Raw Talent, the weekly two-hour programme of new regional music presented by Hull's Alan Raw and produced by Katie Noone for BBC Radio Humberside.<br><br>The first show to be axed from the BBC Radio Leeds airwaves was on Sunday (November 11th).<br><br>A live performance by Leeds' brightest new band, Middleman, was only available to music fans in Leeds via an internet link from BBC Humberside.<br><br>According to BBC Radio Leeds' Managing editor Phil Squire, this situation will not be changed in the foreseeable future.<br><br>Responding to the concerns raised by several Leeds musicians, BBC Radio Leeds said they had "noted concerns regarding the end of the programme on BBC Radio Leeds, but at present we have no plans to make our own programme on similar lines or to bring back Raw Talent in the near future."<br><br>A well-known show and a springboard for many Leeds bands and musicians, Raw Talent has created over a hundred live sessions. Originally broadcast across the whole BBC North on good quality FM, recent weeks have had the even higher quality DAB signal in operation.<br><br>For the last three years one aspect of the programme has been its establishment of and work on the "Unsigned Stage‚Äù at the Carling Weekend: Leeds Festival. Thanks to Alan Raw and the BBC Raw Talent team, Leeds bands have become a regular feature at the festival and have dominated the line up for each of the three years of its existence. Local bands such as The Sunshine Underground were introduced to the festival through the Unsigned Stage and last year the band appeared in front of hundreds in the Radio One Stage.<br><br>Recently Raw Talent has become part of Radio One's Introducing network, and recommendations from the programme have been getting airplay on Huw Stephen's Wednesday night broadcasts.<br><br>Anyone with a view to express over the decision to cease the broadcasting of Raw Talent in Leeds can email BBC Radio Leeds at leeds@bbc.co.uk.</p>
