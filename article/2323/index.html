        <h1>The Horror - First Blood Part II</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "First Blood Part II" recorded by The Horror. The review was written by Paul Geary in 2004.</p>
    <p>The word of the day is Incendiary. The mighty Horror return from what seems an age to unleash a fresh strain of succulent thrash hardcore onto an eager public. What you have here is a culmination of all things right with the UK hardcore scene at the moment. From the opening track "The Horror" to closing track "All Kippers And Curtains" there's not a dog of a track on here. Relentless precision drumming, rumbling powerful bass and quality guitar work.<br><Br>The one thing that elevates The Horror to a higher level has to be Andy Bryant's vocals and lyric writing prowess.  From the excellent "Attack Ships on Fire" (which I thought was about the scene in Blade Runner, but was put right by an annoying friend of mine) to the grin making exotic - "There's a hair salon called dressing gown" indeed. Sung/barked with genuine passion and conviction you can't help but admire the feeling put into this recording.<bR><br>If ever you get the chance to see these live I'd recommend taking the time out to see 'em. Andy Bryant and co. give a fantastic show and usually an interesting rant or two thrown in for good measure.<Br><Br>If you're a fan of bands like The Rites and Army Of Flying Robots then this is your next purchase.</p>
