    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for Samsa.</p>
    <p>Samsa are a 3-piece band from Leeds, West Yorkshire. 2005 saw them share the stage with the Duke Spirit, The Young Knives, Oceansize and Duels, as well as airplay from Steve Lamaqc who made “First, The Lights” his unsigned choice of the week. The track is due for release on Dance To The Radio records in late Feb 2006.<br><br>Samsa released their debut single in summer 2004, a limited edition 7” called “Quiet Places”, on Leeds label Mook Records (The Cribs, The Decoration, Rudolf Rocker). The single prompted a wave of enthusiasm from press and radio, and enjoyed extensive airplay on Radio 1, courtesy of the late, great John Peel. Drowned in Sound called it “a cracker”, Rough Trade “a classic 7”, Sandman Magazine “ suspiciously good” to quote but a few. The track went out on the cover of the first edition of new national music glossy UV Magazine.<br><br>The band, brothers Oli & Jamie Deakin (Vocals/Guitars and Drums, respectively) and boy-from-up-the-road Harry Wood (Bass), began their exploits in the heart of native Cumbria. Having formed Samsa in Leeds in 2003, they are now a significant element of the growing live scene, as well as being regulars at Londons Club Fandango..</p>
