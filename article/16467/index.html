    <p>Doom heavyweights My Dying Bride will play a special one-off show at Damnation Festival, performing new material live for the "first time in many years".<br /><br />The Bradford quintet will return to the Jagermeister Stage they played to a capacity crowd in 2008 for what will be the band's only UK show outside London in 2012.<br /><br />And the rare homecoming appearance will have extra significance for their army of fans as it follows the release of their latest as-yet-untitled album.<br /><br />The band said: "My Dying Bride would like to say just what a great privilege it is to actually play a festival in their home county and to some of us our home town."<br /><br />"Not only is this the second time we will have darkened the Damnation Festival door but this time we will be showcasing for the very fucking first time in many years our brand new material to Damnation Festival's fans first!"<br /><br />Festival director Gavin McInally added: "My Dying Bride's appearance at Damnation Festival in 2008 was one of the best we have hosted and it's a real honour that they have chosen to celebrate the release of the latest album with a return to Leeds."<br /><br />"With Pig Destroyer and My Dying Bride confirmed as our first two bookings, it's shaping up to be a beast of a year and we're confident that we can, once again, put on the best day of metal, rock and eclectic noise the UK has to offer in 2012."<br /><br />Damnation Festival will take place at Leeds University Union on Saturday, November 3rd, 2012. Early bird tickets, priced at just Â£29, will be available until the end of April from www.leedstickets.com and via the official Damnation Festival site.</p>
