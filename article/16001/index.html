    <p>Ultra DIY Wakefield based label Geek Pie Records is proud to announce the release of its first record in 2 years; a split Folk-Pop EP between Glasgow based songwriter Siobhan Reilly and Wakefield based The Passing Fancy.<br /><br />The tracklisting for the EP is:<br /><br />1. Siobhan Reilly - Council Estate Grey<br />2. The Passing Fancy - I Still Feel Great<br />3. Siobhan Reilly - Flitting<br />4. The Passing Fancy - Life is Rich and We are Poor<br /><br />Aside from an appearance on a Geek Pie compilation, 'Life Is Rich...' is the first release by Siobhan Reilly. Born in Airdrie and now based in Glasgow, Siobhan writes delicate, sparse folk music, perfectly showcased on the ghostly EP track 'Flitting'. However there is a definite pop side to her folk too, which is explored on the bouncing, joyous 'Council Estate Grey'.  <br /><br />The Passing Fancy is the working name of Paul Bateson and his ever changing backing band of folky friends. 'Life Is Rich...' sees him present a mix of the new and old; 'I Still Feel Great' is a reworking of one of his most popular live songs 'I Feel Great'. Written when he was but an aspiring folk singer, this new version is much more in keeping with the current 'runaway train' approach of his full band. 'Life Is Rich & We Are Poor' is a brand new song, with the ever present maddening hooks and cheeky lyrical asides.<br /><br />The split single is available now for Â£2 from bandcamp.com.</p>
