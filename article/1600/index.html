    </div>
    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2003.</p>
    <p>Panama Promotions have announced a special show to mark the end of their Autumn 2003 season at The Royal Park Cellars featuring no fewer than six acts from Leeds' and West Yorkshire's rock fraternity - and from farther afield - who will take to the stage in a single evening performance from 8pm to Midnight on Saturday 20th December.<br><br>Steve Kind of Panama - in house promoter at the venue said:<br><br>"It all started when Brody asked Xi to do a Christmas Show with them at the venue - we recruited Huddersfield's Nex to open & were all set for a standard three band night to close out the season"<br><br>Then, rising West Yorkshire rockers The Xenith Sound expressed an interest in playing. Brody had to change their involvement in the show to a special acoustic set from guitarist Tom Allen & vocalist Matt Duggan - but by now there was buzz developing. The venue decided to go all the way & apply for extension to the drinks and entertainment licences.<br><br>This opened the way to add surprise guests to the line-up and the bill will have three full bands interspersed by special appearances from Leeds rock worthies. The current line-up sees the first surprise guests on stage at 8pm - followed by the tongue-in-cheek rock of Nex. Matt and Tom Brody will then make their special one-time-only acoustic appearance followed by The Xenith Sound and the second surprise guest appearance. Dark rockers Xi will close the evening, providing an opportunity to preview new material which is unlikely to be heard in Leeds again before the band release their album in mid-to-late 2004.<br><br>Steve added: "This has been one of our most successful seasons ever in terms of the number of shows we have put on and the quality of bands we have been working with - we want to see 2003 out in style - and this show will help us do it"<br><br>For licensing and demand reasons, admission will be strictly ticket only - tickets are available at Â£5 from any of the bands or from Panama Promotions, who can be contacted on 0113 2741758 or via e-mail at gigs@royalparkcellars.co.uk.</p>
