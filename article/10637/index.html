    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Arrivals" recorded by Worriedaboutsatan. The review was written by Dave Procter in 2009.</p>
    <p>Sample heavy, environmental sound laden electronica is the first phrase that screams in my face at the start of this LP, as an interesting sonic ride begins. <br /><br />Another very welcome sore thumb is the heavy emphasis on the manipulation of the effects themselves, not just the notes/chords played during the compositions. Throw in a lot of electro-acoustic glitch/failure elements and you've got a very complex and challenging journey ahead, but a journey that's always stretching your brain, making you wonder where you've heard that sound or effect before - was it earlier in this track, earlier on the LP, or never before in this universe? Yes, this LP keeps you thinking and guessing and fully alert, which is a good effect as ambience can sometimes lead to bodily shutdown. <br /><br />There's never any danger of that here, and this for me is one of the few electronic music LPs that would be equally at home played in a club, and then played in your home after the club. Some achievement, and no mistake! Like all really outstanding LPs, there is no standout track on this collection, this is an LP (or album if you like) in the truest sense of the word. <br /><br />I'd give it full marks, but that might make these lads rest on their laurels, and I'd like them to push further with experimentation, which they doubtless will. <br /><br />Summing up then, if you've got even the slightest interest in ambient or electro-acoustic <br />music, then this LP should be in your collection. If you haven't, and don't know where to start, the answer is here.</p>
