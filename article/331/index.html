        <h1>She's Not Dead - Bedtime Stories</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Bedtime Stories" recorded by She's Not Dead. The review was written by Richard Garnett in 2003.</p>
    <p>Some very accomplished playing, programming and production work lifts this 3 song (2 and 1 remix) CD out of the "ordinary" category, but limitations in the lyrics and overall sound holds it back from moving into the "extra-ordinary" league.<bR><br>For a young band who seem to have a common strain running through their biog of "Radiohead" you can just about see what is being attempted. However the songs too often cross from heart felt angst into rock musical, a fact not helped by the lead singers west-end stage voice. The over twiddly piano on track "Bedtime Stories (Cut Me Loose)" is impressive but at times has shades of Meatloaf.<Br><br>"Badger + Spoon" has a tougher driving edge but still confuses itself with an albeit memorable but too sweet chorus.<br><br>As such talented musicians, with some truly excellent guitar work, and an ear for a tune, there's no doubting She's Not Dead will eventually be a force to be reckoned with. This on the proviso that by then they will have burnt the back of their throats with too much toxic booze and been dumped by real women!
