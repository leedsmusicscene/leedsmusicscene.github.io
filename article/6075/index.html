    <p>By now you may have seen recent press and radio coverage detailing The Independent Leeds Music Awards 2005 which will take place at The Northern Light in Leeds on Saturday, 7th January 2006.<br><br>Well, here at LMS we have been asked to gather votes for two of the Award Categories, running in conjunction with two other highly regarded local music websites - Cypher Music and Raw Nerve. These awards will be the "Leeds Live Music Venue of the Year 2005" and the "Leeds Backroom Award 2005".<br><br>I'm sure you're interested in how to get your votes registered, so here is the plan of action: nominations will be requested between today and Sunday 11th December with the top ten most nominated venues and backroom persons (across all three sites) then put to a public vote.<br><br>From Monday, 12th December we will be asking you to sign onto our forum to register your votes from the shortlist!<br><br>If you want to put forward a nomination for either category send an e-mail to venueaward@leedsmusicscene.net (venue award) or backroomaward@leedsmusicscene.net (backroom award).<br><br>Backroom Award means guitar techs, roadies, sound guys, etc.<br><br>We'll let you know the shortlist as soon as the nominations are counted!<br><br>For more details on The Independent Leeds Music Awards 2005 visit www.theindependentleedsmusicawards.co.uk.</p>
