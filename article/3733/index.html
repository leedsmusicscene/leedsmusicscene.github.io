        <h1>Panama Promotions to end gigs at Royal Park Cellars...</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2005.</p>
    <p>Panama Promotions, the in-house promoters for the Royal Park Cellars venue in Leeds for the past six years, have announced that they will be pulling out of the venue completely at the end of the current season. The actual final show at the venue will be DUNGEONFEST 5 (the venue's annual metal festival) on July 8th, 9th & 10th - but there will probably be an official "farewell" show slightly earlier. No shows are being booked for the Autumn.<br><br>Promoter Steve Kind had intended in any case to withdraw from involvement with the venue at some point in the next 18 months, but the specific timing has been dictated by a considerable increase in activity by the band Xi - the band Steve manages - who have also been the main crew at RPC operation over the last several years.<br><bR>Panama Promotions took on the role of in-house promoter for the Royal Park at the invitation of landlord Gary Baras early in 2000 when the future of live music at the pub was in serious doubt after a flood in the cellar. Steve was initially assisted by Terry Airth who was principal sound engineer at the venue until his sudden death in November 2001. By that time, he had trained members of Xi on the desk, and 12 months later a bequest from his estate enabled Panama to considerably upgrade the PA, lighting rig and stage.<br><br>"With the help of Terry and the Xi crew - as well as many other willing friends - we've had six great years at RPC" says Steve, "but Terry was passionate about Xi as well, and there is no doubt in my mind that he would have approved of our decision."</p>
