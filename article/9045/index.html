    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for ICS.</p>
    <p>Giuseppe De Luca - Vocals<br /><br />Graham Robson - Drums<br /><br />Iain Bolton - Guitars<br /><br />Josh Weller - Synths<br /><br />After forming in the Hyde Park area of Leeds, ICS had early successes, including; Airplay and interviews on BBC Radio 1 by Both Nick Grimshaw and Steve Lamacq, Nelly's 'ride with me', a cover the band would do during their set went viral after prolific blogger 'Perez Hilton' posted a cover the boys did for the BBC on his infamous blog. The band carried on the blogosphere theme by reaching the coveted number 1 slot on the Hype Machine as being the most blogged music in the world that week.<br /><br />More recently ICS have been featured on the line up of such festivals as Creamfields, Snowbombing and shared the bill with acts such as Foals, Friendly Fires and Calvin Harris.<br /><br />ICS's music has been featured on the Topshop/Topman playlist nationwide, and the band have played numerous 'in-store' shows in the UK at Urban Outfitters and Harvey Nichols.<br /><br />Taking advantage of the contacts made in these initial successes the band decided on a small hiatus from venue shows to take the opportunity to build on their own musical pursuits; with Iain setting up 'Melrose Yard Recording Studios', his own recording studio in York, Graham playing black metal in Leeds band, 'Magpyes', Giuseppe now writes music for various music television companies and Josh has help set up a Leeds based dub step label with other successful musicians and DJ's.<br /><br />It was during this time that ICS agreed to play a set of house parties for friends, invites came through word of mouth and ICS quickly found themselves at the heart of the infamous Leeds house party scene, playing packed out basements, weekly. It is the inspiration of this underground Leeds sound that has forced the boys back into the studio to collate their eclectic tastes and work on a new ICS record with a greater scope and maturity..</p>
