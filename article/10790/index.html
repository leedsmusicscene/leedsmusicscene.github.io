    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2009.</p>
    <p>Leeds band Vib Gyor released their debut album 'We Are Not An Island' on May 25th 2009 as an exclusive download with iTunes USA.<br><br>Having secured 'Single of the Week' with iTunes for their track ‘Fallen’, the band will be playing shows on the East and West Coast of the USA to coincide with the release.<br><br>After some preliminary sessions at the infamous Rockfield studios with Ken Thomas (Hope of the States, Sigur Ros) the band were keen to imprint their own distinct sound to the recordings, and regrouped at their studio in Yorkshire to record and produce the album with band member Zane Keenan at the helm.<br><br>'We Are Not An Island' is the follow up to ‘The Secret’ EP, recorded by Paul Corkett (Muse, Radiohead, The Cure....) at his Studios in Bath. It still receives airplay in the UK (BBC6 Music, XFM Single of the Week & Virgin Extreme) and caused a stir in the US with plays on Indie 103, KRNK and WEQX.<br><br>Two years ago  Vib Gyor headlined the Topman Stage at the Leeds Festival and as a result featured on BBC TV's Look North programme. They were announced as the next band from Yorkshire to make it big after the Arctic Monkeys.<br><br>Maybe, with the help of iTunes nominating them as ‘Single Of The Week’, this prediction may become a reality.</p>
