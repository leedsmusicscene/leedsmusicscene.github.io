        <h1>Samskara - Untitled</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Untitled" recorded by Samskara. The review was written by Sam Saunders in 2004.</p>
    <p>The basic Samskara sound is a rasping flush of rockish guitar riffs, led cheeringly into the foothills of sexual conquest by the bright-voiced hollering of tomcat youth. It's mad and lively enough to rattle the pots and pans, sure enough. The three songs on this demo have been recorded on a 24 track mobile in an upstairs room of a pub. Live-ish, then. And, I guess, quite a good representation of their sound at gigs. There are no frills, no overdubs, no "production". So it works pretty well.<br><Br>But given the tough world they are breaking into, maybe they should have waited a while before getting this demo out. The steamy thrash of a pub room in Pontefract might take their enthusiastic exuberance to its smoky heart, but the precise attention of a Quad amplifier pumping each beat through Rogers speakers points a fickle finger at some obvious shortcomings. Samskara are a long way from oven-ready, so I'll leave the fork of close criticism in the drawer for another day.<br><br>All they really need to know is that song writing is the Devil's Art, and that playing tight four/four as a band needs natural talent (taken for granted) and a huge amount of practice (not yet in the bag).</p>
