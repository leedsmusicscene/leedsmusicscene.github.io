        <h1>Kid iD - Please Tell Your Friends</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Please Tell Your Friends" recorded by Kid iD. The review was written by Paul Drake in 2006.</p>
    <p>I like the cut of Mr. Pelleymounter's jib. Firstly, he's got a pretty fantastical last name. Secondly, his sleeve notes include the words, "If you like this music then feel free to copy, rip, burn and pass it on to as many people as you like." This is an important lesson for unsigned bands; just get your music out there. If it is good, it will demand an audience. If it is shit then write some better music. I could charge for this advice, but I'll follow Mr. Pelleymounter's lead and dish it out for nothing. Feel free to copy, rip or burn this review: depending on your preference.<br><Br>Kid iD remind me of 2002. My palate pre-Hallucinogens resembled that of a 6th form English teacher; plenty of Nick Drake, Alfie and even a little David Gray. Guilty pleasure yes, but 'Please Forgive Me' had a shuffle and slide that soothed my exam-crammed brain. And it is in Alfie especially that I find the Pop sibling of Ralph P & Co., and to Kid iD's credit this E.P is up there with the Manchester group's album 'A Word In Your Ear' in terms of style, craft and melody.<br><Br>For those not familiar with the New Acoustic Movement reference (inspired title, NME), Kid iD use brass, violin, guitar, bass, drums (and djembee apparently) to create delicate sounds for those who like to sit in Summered beer gardens on the outskirts of city centers. You've seen the type, Office drones who order a liquid lunch and talk of the latest fad band. Waste-lines swell and Pectorals become a C-cup, all in the name of being able to write mirthful witticisms on Leeds Music Forum and pretend to be 'in' with the creative crowd. Aspirations cast aside in their grim Cyber Cages.<br><Br>But I digress; this is merely the picture that Kid iD create for me. It is not to their detriment that the appeal of this E.P is so wide, as the middle-of-the-road Dollar is a good Dollar, good research, good marketing. Unfortunately is does nothing for me, and I'm the one entrusted with their baby for today.<br><Br>The lyrical content to 'Please Tell Your Friends' is fairly insightful and to some extent grin inducing at certain junctures. "One of three students has an STD in this Town…and it's hard to do anything while you're itchy with Thrush", informs 'Sofa Statistics' before a groove spangled Jazz outro is added to the broth. It's the type of humour that Ruth Badger and Sir Alan Sugar might laugh at whilst having a toff swearing competition: "Penis Facility", "Arse Regulator", "Cock Robber". Et bladdy Ceterar.<br><Br>I must admit, so far I have painted a confusing picture. But I am confused as to whether I like this E.P. The music arranged by the band is excellent, and it is easy to see why Kid iD won the 2006 Bright Young Things. But it's the lyrics that are throwing me, as they are so throwaway. Twee urban ditties seem contrived, particularly when we have them rammed down our gullet's by The Northern Bastards every day. Personally, I don't want to hear about how shit it is to be living in a federal call-center where cigarettes and coffee keep brains from turning into a pink slop. If you're going to criticise the state of affairs then it can't be tongue in cheek: it must be shredding and incisive. For me anyway…<br><Br>For those not demented by 20th century stagnations then Kid iD may be for you. You are able to brush aside the national rottery, and would find "Please Tell Your Friends" to be a perfect Julio Gallo accompaniment.<br><Br>For those with my particular brand of bitterness then I recommend "Balls To The Bulldog Breed" by 'King Of The Slums'.<br><Br>The Dreg.</p>
