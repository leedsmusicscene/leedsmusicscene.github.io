        <h1>The Scaramanga Six to record new album with Steve Albini</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2012.</p>
    <p>Yorkshire band The Scaramanga Six have this week announced details of their forthcoming recording sessions for what will be the follow up to last year's 'Cursed' album.<br /><br />The band's seventh studio album will be recorded by the legendary Steve Albini (Pixies, Nirvana, PJ Harvey, Wedding Present, Shellac, etc) at his Electrical Audio studio in Chicago this April. <br /><br />What's more, the band have swollen ranks to become a six-piece for the first time in many years with the inclusion of a full second drum kit played by Stephen Stuffy Gilchrist and the piano by James Kenosha. <br /><br />Work is already furiously underway on a barrage of new material and despite the increased numbers, The Scaramanga Six are aiming at a more distilled and desolate sound with more space and dramatic tension than ever before.  <br /><br />The band will attempt to record and mix the entire album in less than a week, playing mainly as live and aiming to capture the rawness and immediacy of performances. <br /><br />Talking of live performances, you can watch the band in Leeds before they head to Chicago as they appear at The Well on 25th February.</p>
