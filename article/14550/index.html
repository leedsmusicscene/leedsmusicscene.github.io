        <h1>Louise Distras - Heart Strings on a Hand Grenade</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Heart Strings on a Hand Grenade" recorded by Louise Distras. The review was written by Matt Bentley in 2011.</p>
    <p>I reviewed Louise's last EP, and my only major complaint then was that the whole thing seemed a little bare - a bit thin if you will - for the style of music she plays. Well, she's sorted that right out on 'Heart Strings an a Hand Grenade.'<br /><br />The EP opens with 'Bullets' which is a fast-paced, multi-layered vocal, multi-layered guitar, incidentally-percussive, acoustic-punk attack! Basically, as many hyphens you can fit into a sentence. It's just a much richer sound than the last EP, and that makes for a much more pleasurable listen. Then there's also the fact that all the songs on display seem more well written than before, but I'll get on to them forthwith!<br /><br />All in all then, the ante has been well and truly upped! So far, so angry...<br /><br />Track two is called 'This Is Your Life;' I kind of hope it's not my life though, as it all sounds a bit upsetting. I like a nice cup of tea and maybe a biscuit in my life, more often than not, and I'm not sure where my brew and biccie fit in here! Having said that, the chorus seems like a nice "get to fuck" to whosoever is the subject matter (I wouldn't want to be them!). I can relate to that; I like telling people to "get to fuck" almost as much as I like tea and biscuits. My life is an endless contradiction of dichotomies, but I digress.<br /><br />Anywho... it's a bit of a slower paced number is track two - until the chorus kicks in that is - and it's a nice one to wang in the middle of the EP. It seems to involve a much straighter guitar sound and no percussion as far as I can hear; the luscious multi-tracked vocals are still there in abundance though. I think I said on the last review that Distras didn't have a great voice, but that she used it well. I'm wavering a little in that view - I think she has a great voice for what she does! Now that it has been captured correctly and layered, it's being put to its best use: brutal in places (quite rightly so) and yet truly haunting in others... which is a big ask for punk!<br /><br />The final track is called 'The Black And Blue.' Now, just before I started writing this paragraph, my beer fired half its contents across the floor! I didn't drop it... I didn't shake it... I just opened it and it fizzed all over the place! I can't decide whether I'm more pissed off about the floor or losing half my beer, but I'll try not to let my bitter disappointment (geddit) affect the rest of the review.<br /><br />The pace picks up again on this last track, and there's also some whistling, which is a bit of a boon. I think it might be about Wakefield, or maybe a person in Wakefield. Either way, the premise is that the town won't change its tune, and that that tune will beat you black and blue. I like that: it's the most cheerful sounding melody on the album (especially with the whistling), but the lyrics are utterly nihilistic:<br />You scan a picture and it's a sunny landscape with laughing children; you look at the picture properly and you notice the gallows in the background with small stick-figure bodies left out for the crows.<br />You half-watch the film and it's a ridiculous comedy of idiots; you pay attention and it's a dark social commentary on voyeurism.<br />It gives the song layers and - as does Shrek - I like onions... I mean layers.<br /><br />So yeah: give this EP a purchase in one way or another. It's a chuffing belter.</p>
