        <h1>Hairstreak - Untitled</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Untitled" recorded by Hairstreak. The review was written by Richard Garnett in 2003.</p>
    <p>Hairstreak was not the German General in Allo Allo but it would perhaps be more interesting if this was. This Leeds-based female fronted five piece play "tracks of a standard most bands can only dream of...". Who these bands are is unclear but if they're dreaming of playing this they need to get out more. The watery self-produced sound that thins the CD out is of no help and the penchant for scary amounts of "sung from the bottom of a well" reverb on vocalist Rachel Evans voice is ill-advised. The opening bars of "Isolation" actually use a tolling bell, thunder and wind! No they really do! After a rather dull v..e..r..y....s..l..o..w 5mins, the more upbeat "Freak" is a change for the better but offers nothing on the memorability stakes. Closer "Razor 1" is "blink-and-you-miss-it" stuff, adding little other than to re-enforce the overall dreary feel.<br><br>As a first offering it's ambitious and suffers from all the gremlins of a DIY production job. A professional studio demo, some songs with the pace set above "meander" and returning the BBC sound effects CD to Leeds City library will offer some hope for the future.</p>
