    <p>When it was time, JP20101985, RA08121985 and JB07061986 did as they were told and went to university in Leeds. They met and played music together for one year. Sometimes they played their music in front of other people. Everyone was doing well in their degrees, and their music was similar to other bands of similar situations, well done boys. In early 2006 they decided that they didnt want work in an office and make money for U.K Plc for the rest of their lives and so they began to spend more of their time making music and less time learning how to shut up and do as one is told. How dare they. They met SP16041985 in April and decided to play some gigs and make some more music. The product was their demonstration of artistic ability, also known as the Community, Identity, Stability E.P which they recorded for a small pouch of silver.<br />

Silly, Silly Record Department, singing of fictitious dream worlds founded on absurd and unrealistic principles such as self autonomy and un-interrupted sleep, who do they think they are? We dont need deviant mischief makers such as these now do we fellow citizens? The old ways are the best, who are they to challenge our values? Who are they to insult us with their offensive and disobedient tone? Damn Record Department and everything they stand for, we fear change, we love traffic jams, eat the soma up, eat the soma up, eat the soma up...........</p>
