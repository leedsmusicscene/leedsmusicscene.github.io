    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Untitled" recorded by This Days Fury. The review was written by Nick Kearns in 2005.</p>
    <p>This Days Fury don’t so much wear their influences on their respective sleeves as paint them in thirty foot high day-glo letters and carry them around on a rotating bill board. From the opening synchronised chord change and cymbal crash to the first widdle-ridden guitar solo we’re in a world ruled by Maiden and Metallica with knowing nods thrown to European contemporaries such as Hammerfall and Nightwish. Yup, it’s metal, and it’s not half bad.<bR><bR>The opening track chugs along smoothly, everything’s as tight as a budgies foreskin and the main guitar riff is cool and quite catchy. Major drawback here though is that one of the guitars sounds as thin and processed as a refined slice of Kraft cheese. Also at nigh on six minutes the song is too long to keep the attention throughout; maybe a trimming operation is in order here.<bR><bR>Second track “Run Away” is an improvement, allowing the vocalist to show an impressive range of dynamics and delivery and showing an altogether more confident and focused approach to songwriting. The chorus has balls of big steel, the solos are tasteful and appropriate and the end result is a well executed metal power ballad.<bR><bR>As a first demo the two songs are a pretty impressive start, and although they are neither hugely original or particularly imaginative there’s plenty of time for This Days Fury to develop their sound and style and give West Yorkshire another fine metal band.</p>
