    <p>Belgrave Music Hall is having a birthday party to celebrate one year in Leeds and everyone is invited. The party will take place at the next Belgrave Street Feast on 11th October and features three award winning vendors, plus the UK d√©but of Leeds' newest Polish street food, Holy Pierogi.<br /><br />Pop Up and Play, the Leeds Company specialising in creative play and craft sessions for families, have also recently taken residence at Belgrave Street Feast in the first floor bar along with the arts market and record fair.<br /><br />Award winning vendors are: Fu-Schinkens (Best of the Best @ British Street Food awards); Fish& (Best Main Dish @ British Street Food Awards); and Noisette Bakehouse (Young British Foodies - Best Baker). <br /><br />Papa Ganoush (Newcastle), Chaat Cart (Manchester), Mash Up, Casa Columbiana, Holy Pierogi, The Real Sue Lee and The Greedy Pig Kitchen join the Belgrave Music Hall regulars of Dough Boys and Patty Smith's Burgers.<br /><br />The venue has also revealed an extensive programme of events for October (see Belgrave Music Hall listings) and is bringing Fu-Schnikens back to the kitchen every Thursday from 2nd October. <br /> <br />Ash Kollakowski said: "Our first year has been amazing, mostly thanks to the people who have bought gig tickets and ate food, but also because of the inspirational independent bars and food establishments in Leeds that have embraced us, such as The Reliance, Friends of Ham, Bundobust, North Bar, Mojo's, Sandinista, Laynes Espresso and many others. Without the independent community Leeds wouldn't be what it is today. Here's to another year, cheers!"<br /><br />Belgrave Music Hall's 1st Birthday & Street Feast is totally free, with lots of stuff for kids to do along with the North's finest street food vendors.</p>
