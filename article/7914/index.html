        <h1>Gobi Wolves - Untitled</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Untitled" recorded by Gobi Wolves. The review was written by Colin Burrill in 2007.</p>
    <p>With a planned debut release in the spring, Leeds experimental/improvisation outfit Gobi Wolves have given us a taste of things to come with an untitled 5-track demo that was recorded in the summer of 2006.<br><br>With shifting arrangements, genre-hopping drum rhythms, dub-like basslines and haunting textures washed down with generous use of delay and reverb (via the means of keys, guitar and electronics), this demo bring moments of suspense, terror and surrealism to the extent in which you feel like you are re-living the world of various characters from an independent horror release from the 80’s.<br><br>This CD does suffer from the raw DIY recording, it’s reasonably unbalanced (the drums are very prominent in the mix) and there is a little hiss all throughout which prevents this collection of improvised pieces gaining a higher score. But even with the minor blemish, there is still enough here to leave you feeling that there are some exciting times ahead as far as the Gobi Wolves are concerned.</p>
