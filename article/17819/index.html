        <h1>Mainline - Interstellar Rock'n'Roll</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Interstellar Rock'n'Roll" recorded by Mainline. The review was written by Paul Smerdyakov in 2013.</p>
    <p>I could start this review by saying "this isn't the type of music I usually listen to", which would detract from the credibility of my criticisms and make it a nicer read for the Mainline lads. But since they describe themselves as pretty much all the genres I listen to the most - garage rock, blues, indie - I can't really offer that loophole. <br /><br />I've seen Mainline live and at the points when I wasn't being stared at/through by a gurning Ian-Brown-alike crowd member, it wasn't terrible and they were well-rehearsed. Having listened to 'Interstellar Rock'n'Roll', I could use the same description for their album, adding "well-produced" in too.  In terms of production it's a lovely sounding album, clear, sculpted and precise. <br /><br />The album starts pretty well; 'Low Down' is a groovy, chugging blues number that puts me in mind of one of those Tom Waits-type tunes they put at the end of a series of The Wire, the American accent fits with the gritty blues feel in the same way Jagger's does.  The harmonica playing is very capable; actually I'll say right now that the stand-out thing about the album is how nice the harmonica sounds. <br /><br />Sadly, it's quickly downhill from there, the second song '5 More Minutes' is so instantly bad that you kind of forget the good start. It sounds like a totally different songwriter to Low Down and not in a good way. Maybe it is, in which case it's an easily solvable problem. Playing the same riff all the way through a song is a very bold move. This particular riff sounds like a million pub-rock band's first songs, it's a chant-a-long for touring LADS. It's the sound The Fratellis make when they snore. <br /><br />High points on the album after Low Down are the Orwell-inspired 'Caught on Camera', with lyrics in the form of snarled warnings, and 'No Turning Back' is an almost acapella interlude that offers something aurally stimulating, it's a side of Mainline I wished they'd pushed more to the fore in this album.<br /><br />I don't think Interstellar Rock'N'Roll is a terrible bunch of songs, I've heard worse, but the album is too long, the pace is plodding and it sags in the middle. In all honesty, I think a shorter EP would've been a better choice. At its best (Low Down) it's groovy and fun, at its worst it sounds like Richard Ashcroft having a drunken game of word association with himself over a Father's Day Dad-Rock compilation. <br /><br />Essentially it's Britpop-Blues rock, songs about getting loaded up and having a great night (All The Way, Do It Again), interspersed with bits and bobs about encounters with women (5 More Minutes, Life Changer) or anti-establishment messages (Caught on Camera, No Free Will). I don't like to slate bands who clearly work hard so I'll say this: these lads have a faithful following and get regular gigs, they do what they do well, I'm just not a fan of what they've done with this album.</p>
