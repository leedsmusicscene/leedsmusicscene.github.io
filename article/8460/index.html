    <p>THE SPILLS are a 4-piece from Wakefield who met at school and bonded over a love of all things noisy and six-stringed.<br /><br />This autumn sees the release of their debut album Occam's Razor, produced by Lee Smith and Jamie Lockhart at Greenmount Studios. Tracked predominantly live to vintage analogue equipment, the album deftly blends youthful rawness with polished guitar pop sensibility ranging between the infectiously hazy glaze-pop of 'Summer Vibes' and 'Oh Say Do' - the darker, atmospheric moments of 'White Flag' and 'Concrete' that nod towards the mood of The National, The Antlers and The Microphones - the occasional plunge into the abrasive dirge of Nirvana or Pavement on 'Heat Death Of The Universe' and 'Jury's Out!'. Occam's Razor is a rough-edged thing of beautiful simplicity that rewards repeat listens with added nuance.<br /><br />In 2009 The Spills released their debut single I'm Scared I Might/Faux Pas Ha Ha, produced by James Kenosha (Dinosaur Pile-up, Pulled Apart By Horses). This was followed in 2010 by their 5 track Smoke Signals EP, this time produced by Smith and Lockhart at Greenmount Studios, which saw the band's sound develop from its noise-rock roots into more carefully crafted pop songwriting, gaining them repeat plays on BBC 6Music Introducing, XFM Xposure and reaching the A-list on Amazing Radio with live favourite 'Holidays'.<br /><br />Live highlights to date include supports for Sky Larkin, Danananaykroyd, Dinosaur Pile-up, Let's Wrestle, Eagulls and festival slots at Tramlines and Live At Leeds in 2010, Long Division in 2011..</p>
