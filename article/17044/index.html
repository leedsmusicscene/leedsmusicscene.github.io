    <p>With their UK tour with Turbowolf having kicked off this week, Leeds latest riff heroes Black Moth have put a new track online for streaming.<br /><br />'The Articulate Dead' is taken from their debut album 'The Killing Jar' which was released earlier this year. <br /><br /><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F58524051&show_artwork=true&wmode=opaque"></iframe><br /><br />The band's influences are obviously there in their sound. Think Proto Metal, Stoner Rock, a healthy slice of Black Sabbath, several shades of Punk, and a big dollop of Doom. The riffs are crushing, the sound is huge and it's all knitted together by Harriet Bevan's formidable vocals, yes we're talking Heavy Rock of the highest order here. But what's truly startling is how the band take all the music that they obviously love and turn it into something that is truly their own, new and heavy. Make no mistake though, these are not just a collection of riffs, but great songs too. Prime rock nuggets with a razorblade at the core.<br /><br />Black Moth are currently on tour with Turbowolf and play at the Cockpit in Leeds on 17th October.</p>
