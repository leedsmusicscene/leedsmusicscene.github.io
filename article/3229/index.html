        <h1>Luke Hirst - A Demonstration By...</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "A Demonstration By..." recorded by Luke Hirst. The review was written by Gavin Miller in 2004.</p>
    <p>Looking all serious and sombre in the accompanying promo pictures, Luke Hirst aka The Saint conjures up the images of windswept mountains, upon which he pours his heart out to a soft rock soundtrack.<br><br>Whereas 'Stories To Tell' has a pleasant enough melody and catchy guitar playing, it does tend to stray a bit too far to the middle of the road for my liking. Add to it some wise-before-your-years-sonny lyrics (he's only 16) and his CD gets off to a little bumpy start.<br><br>'Changing Lanes' is a melodic stab at the heartfelt anthem, with lyrics about breaking hearts and such. Nice enough song though, but maybe a bit less of the over zealous production would be nice. The cheesy synth strings try to add a bit of depth and sweeping atmospherics, but somehow fall short of their intended aim. Still, his voice, guitar playing and indeed, all the instrumentation are on form.<br><br>'Amber' rounds things off, but starts off with an ill advised half talked, half sung intro of "Amber was a girl, she would fight her own fights". Still, apart from the suspect vocal delivery, the song is a fair enough crack at sweeping balladry.<br><br>Fair play to Luke Hirst, he's only 16, and he's making records that sound as competent as this one. You can well imagine any track on this 3 track CD being played on FM radio or whatever, and that goes to show that the production of a record is still very important. I'd be lying if I said it was my cup of tea, but The Saint, or Luke or whatever he calls himself can pen a tune, has the voice and has the talent. Just give him a few years and he'll be on top of his game for sure. For a glimpse of what's yet to come, investigate. </p>
