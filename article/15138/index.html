    <p>A local music and education charity is hoping to hit the right note with the people of Leeds, when it opens a unique event showcasing the city's exciting music scene this month.<br /><br />Cloth Cat Studios, which is dedicated to improving people's lives through music in the area, is providing a rare opportunity to delve into the past at the Leeds Music History Exhibition, which will take place at Leeds Town Hall between Friday 12th and Saturday 27th August. <br /><br />The exhibition is free to the general public who will be able to sample the eclectic range of musical activity founded in the city through displays of photos and other memorabilia collected over the last 50 years.<br /><br />Held during the Leeds Fringe Festival, there will also be a one-off gig at Brudenell Social Club on Friday 19th August, featuring some of the bands who have been successful over the years including The Chris Reed Unit (from Red Lorry Yellow Lorry) and Nights On Mars featuring Philip Brennan from The Three Johns and Fiona Gregg from The Parachute Men .<br /><br />The Leeds music scene has been a long and varied one, from the crooners of the 50s and 60s to the explosion of Punk and Rock in the 1970s, which led to guitar bands forming all over the city; and the Goth days of the early 80s through to the current day with local bands the Kaiser Chiefs and The Pigeon Detectives topping the charts.<br /><br />The idea behind the exhibition is to celebrate the vast array of bands and musicians, along with promoters, DJs, shops, studios and producers, who have had an impact on the culture within the city as well as on a wider basis. <br /><br />Mike Jolly, project co-ordinator, Cloth Cat, said: "We felt that a celebration of Leeds music was long overdue. There have been some fantastic performers to come out of the area over the years and this exhibition will give people an opportunity learn more about the local music scene as well as, we hope, rekindle some memories. <br /><br />"There have also been many unsung heroes who have played a major role in defining local music culture and the resulting work of this project will give an insight in to the heritage of the city. We're also hoping to inspire a whole new generation of local bands." <br /><br />The Leeds Music History Exhibition is open from 9am - 5pm each day.</p>
