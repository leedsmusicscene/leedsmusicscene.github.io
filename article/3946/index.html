    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2005.</p>
    <p>Five of Leeds’ finest live acts are to appear at a free festival in Middlesbrough on Sunday 19th June. The Cribs, The Research, Duels, Black Wire and Robochrist will all play at the Middlesbrough Music Live festival alongside the likes of The Thrills, Nine Black Alps, The Paddingtons and around 100 other bands.<br><bR>The festival, now in its sixth year, provides ten hours of free music and is spread across ten stages in the town’s centre. For a full line-up visit www.middlesbroughmusiclive.co.uk.<br><br>Festival promoter Graham Ramsay, whose company Ten Feet Tall books the bands for organisers Middlesbrough Council, said “The Leeds scene is absolutely vibrant at the moment, and it’s no surprise that so many of the acts we’ve booked this year are from the area. Kaiser Chiefs played at Music Live in 2004, and it was obvious to anyone who saw them then that they were going to be massive. I’ve no doubt that some it not all of the Leeds bands we’ve booked this year will be following in their footsteps.”</p>
