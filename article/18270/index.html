    <p>Live at Leeds have announced a slew of additions to this year's bill, including some of the most promising bands to have emerged over the last year, such as The Fat White Family, George Ezra, and Tennis, as well as local faves The Sunshine Underground.<br /><br />Other additions include Years & Years, Woman's Hour, The Bug, Big Ups, Beastmilk and many more.<br /><br />The 50 additional bands (see new line up poster attached) extend an already impressive Live At Leeds 2014 line up that was announced earlier this year and which now also includes Forward Russia at Leeds Town Hall.<br /><br />This year the event has expanded and will be welcoming Leeds Town Hall, Belgrave Music Hall, HiFi Club and Oporto as new venues. On top of this there will be additional stages at both Brudenell Social Club and The Faversham.<br /><br />Tickets for the Live At Leeds 2014 all dayer (Saturday 3rd May) can be purchased for just Â£25 via Leeds Gig Tickets. <br /><br />Tickets are exchanged for wristbands on the day of Live At Leeds 2014.</p>
