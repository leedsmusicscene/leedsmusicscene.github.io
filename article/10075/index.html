    <p>Beat Street International were established in 1998 and since then we have built a healthy client base, regularly engaging the band to perform at a vast and varied amount of events throughout the whole of the United Kingdom and to parts of Europe, bi-annually we even travel as far as Eilat in Southern Israel. Our energy filled performances grip audiences from the moment we take to the stage until well after the show has concluded.<br /><br />Our corporate clientèle range hugely from financial organisations such as Egg Plc and supermarket giants ASDA through to government clientèle such as the Armed Forces and the Student Union. With an awesome repertoire catering for mixed age groups, we are typically engaged to perform at weddings, corporate and special events, outdoor festivals, galas and fêtes, also at company product launches and at parties for all occasions. A good proportion of the bands approximate 200 shows per annum are repeat engagements and recommendations from previous clientele.<br /><br />We carry a high end sound reinforcement system, utilising room analysis software, which in short ensures our sound system is optimised for each individual venue in which we perform, thus producing wonderful sound quality at a comfortable level. We also carry our own lighting system and all equipment carries portable appliance test (PAT) certification and the band are insured for up to £5,000,000 for public liability claims in the extremely unlikely event of any accidental injury to third parties.<br /><br />We are a team of experienced, professional and highly motivated musicians who are exorbitantly passionate about our art and performance. We will work buoyantly with you and/or your event organisers, paying attention to detail to ensure that the entertainment at your event is a huge success and that nothing has been left to chance..</p>
