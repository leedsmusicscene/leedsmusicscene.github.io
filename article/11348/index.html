    <p>Almost four years after the release of Corinne Bailey Rae’s four million-selling debut album, Virgin Records have this week announced the release of Corinne’s second album ‘The Sea’.<br><br>The new album will be released in February 2010 on the Good Groove label.<br><br>Corinne started work on the songs for her second album at the end of 2007, following a whirlwind two years which saw her become a worldwide multi-platinum, award-winning artist with a string of Grammy and Brits nominations to her name.<br><br>The album was recorded in Leeds and Manchester and was co-produced by Corinne Bailey Rae with two separate producers, Steve Brown and Steve Chrisanthou.<br><br>In a recent interview with the Observer Music Monthly Corinne said, "There is something miraculous that pushes you along, makes you keep going, makes you carry on. It's really about the mystery of that. In fact, the whole album is about that in a way; it's about loss but it's also about hope, about keeping going and trying to find that beauty".</p>
