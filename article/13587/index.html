    <p>"Great f'ckin' voice!" Laura Jane Grace, Against Me!<br />"Flying the flag for all female artists!" BBC Radio 1<br />"Putting Punk and protest back into the mainstream!" The Guardian<br /><br />Louise Distras is no shrinking violet. Whilst the music world is currently dominated by Simon Cowell backed pop-puppets who have a tendency to fade into obscurity before they even reach the sophomore stage, this British post-punk singer songwriter is a musician who has every intention of making a longer lasting impression. <br />Like the great storytellers and social observers before her - from Bob Dylan through to the Sex Pistols, Distras has successfully channelled her anger and vocalised her hopes and fears in to her critically acclaimed debut 'Dreams from the Factory Floor'.With songs that tick both the post-punk and pop boxes, her explosive lyrics and riotous sonic disposition, it is little surprise that Distras is already garnering comparisons to charged songstresses Brody Dalle, Juliette Lewis and Courtney Love, but it won't be long before other artists are being compared to her. With so much to say, and such a distinct manner with which she says it, Distras's star continues to rise in 2016 with the heavily anticipated follow up to her 2013 debut 'Dreams from the Factory Floor'.Having been heralded for her ability to incorporate the acoustic guitar into riotous pop songs, it is obvious that Distras is about to make a big mark in the music industry game - but unlike Cowell's puppets, Distras will be holding the strings and playing by her own rules.<br />2013 onwards has seen Louise Distras cutting her teeth on the world stage, touring across the UK, Europe, Canada and the USA with the likes of Billy Bragg, Buzzcocks, Stiff Little Fingers and The Damned, taking in festival appearances at Glastonbury, Bearded Theory, Rebellion and Punk Rock Bowling (USA) whilst receiving notable praise from The Guardian, Big Cheese,New Noise and Big Takeover magazines aswell as BBC Radio 1, XFM, Team Rock Radio, and KROQ who have all accurately pinpointed Distras' sound as "the rebirth of British punk; reinvented for a new generation". <br /><br />"The UKs answer to Joan Jett!" Rodney Bingenheimer, KROQ Radio<br />"Big electric anthems for yet another let down generation" John Robb, Louder Than War<br />"I love this chick! So good, so truly punk rock!" Linda Perry, 4 Non Blondes.</p>
