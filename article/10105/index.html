    </div>
    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2008.</p>
    <p>A twelve day citywide celebration of Irish arts and culture kicks off in Leeds from the 6th - 17th November. Dozens of events including music sessions, literary, film and theatrical events and talks are planned to take place at venues across Leeds, bringing Ireland’s finest artists to the city.<br><br>Organized by the Irish Arts Foundation, based in Leeds, events are designed to appeal to both those of an Irish background and people from the wider community with an interest in music and the arts. Rowena Harris, Development Officer explains, “The idea is to provide a unique opportunity for the Irish community in Leeds to showcase their rich and vibrant cultural traditions. This year also sees an exciting development of the Gathering's and indeed Irish Arts Foundation's national remit: we are working in partnership with our colleagues at Liverpool Irish Festival and the Return to Camden Festival in London where the IAF are hosting various events. It is through this shared expertise that we can really raise the profile of Irish Arts on a national level”.<br><br>Now in its fourth year, The Leeds Gathering features some of the most dynamic local, national and international performers and artistes in the world of Irish Arts. This year’s festival is to be headlined by Frankie Gavin with Mike Galvin, Mary Coughlan, Dick Gaughan and Grada. These names represent some of the most established acts on the Irish Music circuit and they are complimented by a plethora of local and national arts practitioners throughout the festival.</p>
