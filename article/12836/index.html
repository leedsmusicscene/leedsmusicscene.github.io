    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for Further From The Truth.</p>
    <p>Further From The Truth are a super-charged, female fronted heavy rock band from West Yorkshire, UK, formed in 2008. The band members are Kat Birch (Lead Vocals), James Preston (Lead Guitar), Nick O'Rourke (Lead Guitar), Craig Freeman (Lead Bass) and Mark Lightwood (Lead Drums).<br /><br />FFTT was originally formed in 2008 by Nick O'Rourke and James Preston after their decision to disband their previous 3 piece "tech rock" band Motaro Wins, in search for something more bitchin'.<br /><br />2009 was the year of recruitment. As the months went by band members came and went - some were missed, and some were not - but the lineup which remained has become the preverbial "cream of the crop" - the "holy grail".<br /><br />After Nick and James had sat for a few months drafting out some songs to point the band in a direction and taken the group through a couple of shaky first gigs, along came Kat Birch. After seeing the Welsh superstar in the making's performances in 'Starksy' and 'Aveneta' (her previous bands) FFTT began to develop an elaborate plan of espionage, kidnapping and brainwashing in order to assimilate her into the band. Turns out all they needed to do was send her an email telling her when the next practice was.<br /><br />A few dodgy nights out later and the inevitable reuniting with drummer Mark Lightwood (also from Motaro Wins) became a reality. Where Kat brought the matter, Mark brought the anti-matter, and with two new band members joining in the space of what felt like as many minutes FFTT went from "another local band" to "oh my... phwoaaar".<br /><br />The band went on to play Leeds, Wakefield, Bradford, Huddersfield, Manchester and the surrounding areas steadily building up momentum and a following with their faithful bassist Chris Mitchell. Then in the early months of 2010 Chris hung up his bass strap to become a full time dad, saying a fond farewell to FFTT. Sad to see him go, the band began yet another hunt for a member.<br /><br />Their cries were answered almost overnight once again - and this time by the larger than life, insanely powerful yet gentle as a lamb with velvet mittens on Craig Freeman, a bassist from Bramley. So lucky it could've almost been illegal FFTT couldn't have found a more perfect fit for their bottom-end requirements.<br /><br />Now up to full speed, the band is gigging heavily in Yorkshire. They have been chosen to play at Wakefield Rock Festival and the Crown of Lights festival in 2010 and have currently just finished recording their first AA side single "Backstabbing B1tch / Crimson Smile", to be released by themselves both on and offline..</p>
