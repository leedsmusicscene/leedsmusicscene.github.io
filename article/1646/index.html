    <p>Sam Riley (vocals)<br />George Riley (bass)<br />Davro (guitar)<br />Will Newman (guitar)<br />Justin Jackson (percussion)<br />Stob (drums)<br /><br />"Now that Leeds has been anointed the new Manchester of the North it needs its own Oasis and this ragged 6-piece easily fit the bill..."  Steve Jelbert The Times<br /><br />Rumour has it there's a volcanic new scene waiting to erupt in the vicinity of Leeds, if that's so then at its core must surely be 10,000 Things, a six-man explosion of riff and mischief who are stunning large, rowdy crowds every time they play in the city.<br /><br />They've been together for two years honing their skills in basements, pubs and dingy rehearsal spaces, and are now ready to unleash their rockin' mash-up nationwide.<br /><br />Singer Sam Riley writes eloquent cries of everyday life - boys struggling with the rent, arguing with their loved ones, drinking to forget their rubbish jobs - but they're never maudlin. These are life-affirming songs with wit, humanity and fierce energy.<br /><br />A recent show at the Camden Monarch attracted jaw-to-the-floor comments such as: "The New Yorkshire Dolls", "Un-fucking-believable" and "the sexiest band I've ever seen". Heads turned, adrenalin rushed and hearts throbbed. Do not miss them when they come your way.<br /><br />Now they have recorded a d√©but EP on Domino/Dusty Company with the legendary Phill Brown, a man who was in the room when 'All Along The Watchtower', 'Stairway To Heaven' and 'Sympathy For the Devil' were recorded. It took one look at 10,000 Things live in a Leeds back street, to convince this venerable producer that here was the stuff of future legend. And yes, the sessions included a run-in with the law, a cross-country dash, a sideboard full of skunk and a lake of milky tea. And that was just day one..</p>
