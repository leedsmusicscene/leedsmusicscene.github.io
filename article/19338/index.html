    <p>A great line up, this week at 360 Club Leeds, with a range of artists from Folk pop to Alt rock.  Gracing the Lending Room at the Library in Hyde Park are Fitzwallace, Fran Minney, Hobson and Jolly and the Lightweight.  <br /><br />Country, folk, pop band Fitzwallace, who have recently attracted a lot of interest from press and radio.  They incorporate vocal harmony into their music, taking influence from artists such as Fleetwood Mac, The Civil Wars, The Eagles and Zac Brown Band.  Their second EP 'Sweetheart' released in May 2015 is available from major download stores and their Bandcamp page. <br /><br /><iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3860208268/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless>Sweetheart by Fitzwallace</iframe><br /><br />Fran Minney, will appear with full band.  An artist who tells stories, singing of her experiences, wild forces of emotions and nature. Fran and her band are bringing audiences folk-pop with a soulful twist, as well as moments of raw emotion felt through alternative rock influences.<br /><br /><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/225644149&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe><br /><br />Leeds based 6 piece alt rock band Hobson have been sourcing new members (Drums, Bass and Lead Guitar), writing and practicing ready for the 360 club gig where they will release their independent EP 'Ms Understood' and any proceeds will go towards recording their first album, which with the new members, is looking to be something a little different than what you'd expect!<br /><br />Jolly and the Lightweight are an energetic folk rock trio formed in November 2014 in Leeds, after meeting in their student accommodation.  They are all students from Leeds College of Music.  The band's sound is centred around folk, with a contemporary rock edge and a bluesy feel. The boys possess an upbeat and energetic stage presence, creating an exciting live performance.  They have released "Paper Heart" and Brothers and Sisters".  <br /><br />Tickets are available from Jumbo Records & Crash Records or OTD. 18+ event</p>
