    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Ignition" recorded by Terra-ist. The review was written by Rosie Driver in 2015.</p>
    <p>Local lads Terra-ist have been cooking up a storm recently following their DROP headlining stint at Hyde Park's Unity Day. The Yorkshire Evening Post has described them as grimy and dirty tunes with addictive bass lines fusing trip-hop, dubstep and old school drum and bass. Their new single, Ignition (Feat Sky Stars) is due to be released on the 30th October lives up to all of their promises and more.<br /><br />The opening bars instantly grab your attention with lively drums before the vocal hits. Politically charged lyrics charge through as a fast paced rap, culminating in a metal infused angry chorus. Repeated lyrics, 'Never hold me down' are firmly in your head by the end of the song, reinforcing the political steer of the track. Accompanying the catchy lyrics are intense drums and heavy guitars. Towards the end of the track a reggae vibe come through, chilling out the intense earlier vibes which enhance the message throughout. You can imagine the band blowing the roof off with their passion, that oozes throughout.  <br /><br />Since arriving on the music scene they have attracted the likes of the Yorkshire Evening Post, BBC Introducing and Vibrations Magazine commented that they could be your new favourite band. Accompanying the release of the single will be a launch gig at 360 Club in Leeds on the 30th October (Upstairs at The Library). If you like solid bass, catchy lyrics and banging drums then they are definitely one to go and watch.</p>
