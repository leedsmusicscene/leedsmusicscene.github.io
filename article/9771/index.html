    <p>Piskie Sits and The Spills have released a split EP on the Louder Than Bombs record label on 23rd June 2008. Available on CD, and titled ‘Dogs are Faithful, Cats are Clever‘, the EP includes two songs per band (“Ghost Of The Day” and “Testing” from The Spills” and “Sonic Oof” and “Out” from Piskie Sits).<br><br>After a couple of singles and an album on Wrath Records, Wakefield's Piskie Sits decided it was time to move on. With a couple of new members and a load of new songs Piskie Sits are ready to release their first songs since their highly acclaimed debut album 'Secret Sickliness'. They've been busy since their debut albums 2007 release with a Radio One session for Huw Stephens, a spot at Leeds Festival and gigs with the likes of The Fall, Envelopes, Make Model, Frightened Rabbit, and Times New Viking.<br><br>Also from Wakefield and good friends with Piskie Sits, The Spills haven't seen quite as much action their EP mates yet but you couldn't tell from their live performances in which they've supported the likes of Nine Black Alps, Fear Of Music, Grammatics, The Wombats and more. Ross Jarman from The Cribs, Matt Bowman from The Pigeon Detectives, all of The Research and Last Gang have all declared themselves as fans of the band after watching their raucous live set. They've released one download-only single so far but with production from James and Jon from Leeds band Duels on this record they've managed to capture their powerful live sound for the first time.</p>
