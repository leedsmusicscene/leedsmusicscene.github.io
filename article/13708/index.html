    <p>Leeds College of Music is helping Leeds band Escort Knights in their search for the definitive remix of their single 'I Don't Know Your Name'.<br /><br />The track was recently launched as the official soundtrack for the new Leeds Arena and has received significant radio play on stations across the UK and BBC Introducing. Escort Knights are touring the UK this autumn to promote the single including a single launch at A Nation of Shopkeepers on Saturday 13th November.<br /><br />The winning remix will feature on the B-side of Escort Knights' forthcoming vinyl single release (due spring 2011) as well as being available to download on iTunes. The remix will also be available to stream on Escort Knights' web pages and Leeds College of Music website to ensure the song gains maximum exposure.<br /><br />Joe from the band states: "We are hoping to receive as many new and creative interpretations of the song as possible. We are open to all styles of remix, but ones featuring a large amount of the original vocal hook and that are concise in duration would be especially welcome. The remix will also be plugged to the radio stations who have already played the original during the I Don't Know Your Name tour".<br /><br />The entries will be judged by internationally renowned DJ and producer Simon Baker, as well as the band members. <br /><br />Potential remixers can download the stems at Sound Cloud.<br /><br />To submit an entry, please email escortknights [ at ] hotmail.com.<br /><br />The closing date for entries is Friday 10 December 2010.</p>
