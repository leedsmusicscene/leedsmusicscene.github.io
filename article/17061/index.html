        <h1>Rupert Stroud releases new single 'Twisted Games'</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2012.</p>
    <p>After two critically acclaimed albums, regular adulation and live appearances on BBC Introducing shows up and down the country and several exciting festival appearances, Rupert Stroud is now back with brand new single 'Twisted Games'.<br /><br />The leading track 'Twisted Games' has rich wall of sound from the offset. Skilfully intercut with intimately sombre bluesy verses, Stroud's compelling vocals and signature inventive beat driven arrangements are on better display than ever. B-Side 'No Peace of Mind' is a softer yet just as enticing track following the bluesy themes of the single as a whole. The overall sound adds a bit of James Morrison to Stephen Fretwell, Richard Ashcroft to Ray LaMontagne and Mark Lanegan to Boo Hewerdine.<br /><br />Stroud started out playing the Yorkshire gig circuit as a solo acoustic artist penning his debut Rupert Road along the way. He was discovered by eminent British producer Will Jackson (The Kaiser Chiefs, Embrace, The Cribs, The Music) who adamantly brought Rupert into his studio to record. Stroud's second album 'Chasing The Night', again with Will Jackson as producer, brought Stroud to wider acclaim securing a huge host of online support, national press features and well received slots amongst incredible line ups at Live at Leeds and Galtres Festival 2012. <br /><br />Mick Bedford on drums and Mike Pearson on keys and guitar are now permanent fixtures in Rupert's line-up. As the three evolved into a dynamic group, around the recording of 'Chasing the Night', Stroud was set apart from the usual singer/songwriter status quo. They are often joined on stage by songbird Kate Peters, primarily a jazz singer, who also sings backing vocals on 'Chasing The Night'.<br /><br />Watch the official video below:<br /><br /><iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/6ReX1qdSpFM?wmode=opaque" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br /><br />The new Single 'Twisted Games' is out now via iTunes, Amazon and Xidus Music.</p>
