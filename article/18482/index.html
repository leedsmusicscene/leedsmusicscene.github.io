    </div>
    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2014.</p>
    <p>The two piece, Knuckle, are Ben Wallbanks (Kava Kava, Your New Antique, Steve Albino and the Lovesocks) and Jonny Firth (Crybabycry, Jonnythefirth).  Their filthy garage blues music has recently been described as "The Black Keys on crack" and they are steadily gaining a reputation for explosive live sets and the artistic freedom of their compositions.   <br /><br />Career highlights so far have included sets at all over west Yorkshire, Live at Leeds, also London shows at The Old Blue Last (Shoreditch) and Birthdays (Dalston).   Reviewers have praised the lightning fast and intricate style of drummer Ben Wallbanks and singer/guitarist Jonny Firth's emotive blues lyrics and engaging vocal range as well as his energizing fuzzy guitar riffs. <br /><br />Recorded at Greenmount Recording Studios in Leeds, 'Living Hell' is their first self-released single available as a "pay what you want" download from their Bandcamp page. <br /><br />http://weareknuckle.bandcamp.com/<br /><br />Second single "Ejector Seat" will follow in the next few months before their debut E.P. which is set to be released in September on the revered Wakefield label Philiophobia Music, who are also responsible for releases from other fantastic bands including The Spills, Imp and Runaround Kids.<br /><br />Next live date is at Coffee Evolution, Huddersfield on the 30th May.</p>
