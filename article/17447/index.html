    <p>The second wave of artists for Wakefield's Long Division Festival has been announced today.<br /><br />Cult singer-songwriter Jeffrey Lewis will be joined by guitarist Peter Stampfel on Saturday June 8th, along with Allo Darlin', This History Of Apple Pie, This Many Boyfriends, Sky Larkin, That Fucking Tank and Blacklisters.<br /><br />They join The Fall, whose performance in Wakefield will coincide with the release of their 30th album.<br /><br />The city festival, now in its third year, is known for its support of DIY ideals and for its eclectic range of venues within minutes of each other across the city.<br /><br />Jack Daniel's JD Roots, which celebrates local music scenes, has partnered with Long Division to present a full day of live music upstairs at The Hop, mixing thriving new talent as diverse as Blacklisters and The Michael Ainsley Band with inspirational DIY artists such as Nine Black Alps, Skint & Demoralised and Allo Darlin'.<br /> <br />Leeds based Hee Haw Sessions will curate the Grade II listed Orangery stage, with a selection of exceptional acoustic acts, headlined by RM Hubbert.<br />     <br />Wolfboy Records will host the day's events at Velvet, including Rosie Doonan and Jonnythefirth collaboration Cry Baby Cry, the much-hyped Witch Hunt, and Rosie & The Howling North.<br /><br />The festival is organised by Wakefield fanzine Rhubarb Bomb and takes place in many interesting unusual spaces. On top of those listed above, other venues include former library Drury Lane, Wakefield Theatre Royal, Mustangs and Warehouse 23.<br /><br />Tickets for Long Division 2013 can be purchased via the Yorkshire Gig Guide website priced at Â£20 (plus booking fees).</p>
