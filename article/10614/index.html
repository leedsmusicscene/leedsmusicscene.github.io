        <h1>Daybreakers - The Dawn Approaches</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "The Dawn Approaches" recorded by Daybreakers. The review was written by Jessica Thornsby in 2009.</p>
    <p>The debut EP from Leeds based Daybreakers makes liberal use of a jazz triple-header of trombone, trumpet and saxophone, in addition to the usual guitars and drums. <br /><br />  EP opener 'Into The 5th Dimension' is riotous ska-punk with kooky lyrics ("we're travelling through space at light speed flat / and I think I forgot my hat.") that give it a certain geeky appeal.<br /><br />  The whole song is underpinned by rumbling drumbeats that act as a deeper, more resonating counterpoint to its jazzy highs. The interaction between these two opposing sounds is inspired. This is especially true of the instrumental introduction, where each drumbeat is spiked with a jazzy note; and a bridge section where a trumpet climbs ever higher, only to judder back down in perfect synchronisation with the drumbeats.<br /><br />  'Into The 5th Dimension' ricochets between relatively sparse verses - where the main attraction is those trippy lyrics - and an instrumental chorus of hard-partying, ska-punk jazziness. It's an uncomprimising song. Right from the start, you'll know whether Daybreakers are the band for you.<br /><br />  Like 'Into The 5th Dimension,' second track 'It Aint Easy' hinges on the ricochet between jazzy outbursts, and periods of straightforward indie-rock. <br /><br />  The verse switches between a short bass sequence, and walls of shrapnel-like jazz and huge vocals. This ricochet effect means that 'It Aint Easy's all-out jazz moments feel heart-stoppingly sudden and enthralling.<br /><br />  'It Aint Easy' is a stylish, groovy rock song spiked with razor-sharp jazz hooks.<br /> <br />  Daybreakers are on to a winner with the military beats of 'Beautiful Machine.' With only the occasional jazzy flourish to detract from the verse's bone-rattling drumbeats, 'Beautiful Machine' is a heads-down, rumbling rock song.<br /><br />  Daybreakers do occasionally deviate from that great central beat, as screeching jazz instruments hustle the listener into a riotous, ska-punk chorus where frontman George Quinn chants the wonderfully no-brainer refrain of "she's a beautiful machine / she's a beautiful machine" over and over.<br /><br />  'Beautiful Machine' packs a helter-skelter chorus, and a deadly-serious verse, proving that one song really can deliver the best of both worlds.<br /><br />  'The Dawn Approaches's casual groove and verses of swaying guitars rhythms might not immediately leap out and grab you, but after a few spins its laidback melodies will well and truly have wound their way into your brain.<br /><br />  Even better are the song's instrumental sections; namely, a chorus of buzzy riffs, and a bridge section where serrated chords cut through that continuous background buzz.<br /><br />  During the verses, 'The Dawn Approaches' delivers a poised, steady groove but, when Quinn stops singing, this song really comes into its own, as Daybreakers prove they know how to pen an instrumental passage. <br /><br />  EP-closer 'Keep It Coming Keep It Flowing' is another Daybreakers song that improves past the halfway point. The overlong introduction and first verse, are underpinned by tribal-tinged, rumbling drumbeats, edged in glimmering riffs and an unobtrusive undercurrent of jazz instruments. It's in danger of becoming a little samey but, thankfully, things pick up after the first chorus, as the verses of 'Keep It Coming Keep It Flowing' adopt a quicker drumbeat and the chords become more crackly, making for a harder-rocking, brisker listen.<br /><br />  'Keep It Coming Keep It Flowing's post-first-verse improvement is also due to a heady chorus where Quinn's voice and the jazz instruments judder ever higher, attaining dizzying heights before its time for the next verse.<br /><br />  A headrush of screeching jazz, jerking chords and rollicking drumbeats bring this song to a short, sharp and exhilarating conclusion. Initially, 'Keep It Coming Keep It Flowing' seems like nothing special, but it's worth sticking with, as it does get much better.<br /><br />  With 'The Dawn Approaches' EP, the focus is firmly on the music, and Daybreakers know how to bring rock and jazz together. At times, it delivers lively, straightforward ska-punk, but mostly, this EP takes a more thoughtful approach to blending rock and jazz. This is a record for people who love ska-punk, but sometimes wish that the genre could be about more than just getting people to dance like maniacs and have a good time. Jazzy rock, with some rare thought behind it.</p>
