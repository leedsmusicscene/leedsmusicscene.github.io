    <p>Dead Young Records presents the very first High & Lonesome festival, which looks to celebrate the influence of Americana in modern music. To be held on Saturday 22nd November 2014, the festival will incorporate three of Leeds' finest independent venues; Holy Trinity Church, The Belgrave Music Hall & Oporto at it's heart.<br /><br />Organiser Harry Ridgway explained "We initially conceived of High & Lonesome as a celebration of Americana music, however, the idea has grown to include sincere & emotionally resonant music still touching on the genre, but reaching further out into it's modern influences on acoustic, folk, alt-country & pop."<br /><br />The event aims to showcase the most exciting new talent alongside the more established elements of the UK & international scenes. The first wave of line up announcements reflects the many and varied forms Americana's influence takes...<br /><br />Patrick Wolf<br />Rachel Sermanni<br />Ellen and the Escapades<br />Paul Thomas Saunders<br />Farewell JR<br />Ajimal<br />Tessera Skies<br />Boss Caine<br />Hunting Bears<br />We Died at Sea<br />Charlie Stott<br />Avalon Peacock<br />The Sea Whores<br /><br />These acts & many more to be announced will be hosted in central Leeds in beautiful and unique venues. The main focal point will be the 300 year old, Grade I listed Holy Trinity Church, a stunning venue which not only boasts beautiful architecture but also phenomenal acoustics.<br /><br />The second stage, hosting a more progressive line up will be the much newer Belgrave Music Hall & Canteen, already famed for being at the forefront of new music in the city as well as the UK's exploding Street Food movement.<br /><br />The third venue is the infamous and award winning Oporto, home of Dead Young Records & the long running Gaslight Club acoustic night, both integral parts of the vibrant Leeds music scene.<br /><br />Running from midday until 11pm, along with after parties at Oporto & Belgrave, the hand picked line up will be complemented by fringe events and specially selected extras. This will include a record fair, film screenings and pop up acoustic sessions as well as themed street food and drinks menus. <br /><br />Dead Young Records' Nick Simcock enthused "We're thrilled to have international acts such as Patrick Wolf and Rachel Sermanni announced already in our first year. The response from artists has been inspiring, from headliners to break through local act Ellen & the Escapades, critically acclaimed & Atlantic signed former resident Paul Thomas Saunders and more. We're keen to make the festival an annual highlight for both artists and fans alike"<br /><br />Tickets are on sale now for the limited early bird price of Â£16 from pillars of the independent scene Crash Records & Jumbo Records, They will be exchangeable for wristbands on the day, granting access to all 3 venues as well as special offers around the city.<br /><br />For ticket links and more information please see:<br /><br />www.facebook.com/HighandLonesome <br />Tweet @HighandLonesome<br />www.highandlonesome.co.uk - coming soon</p>
