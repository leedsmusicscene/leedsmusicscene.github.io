    <p>In Summer 2006 *Armstrong self-released their debut single, reaching 23 in the Independent Charts. The band filmed the video with producer of CD:UK Ashley Cowan. They have played sold out shows in venues nationwide, including The Fly and Barfly in London, and have supported the likes of the Pigeon Detectives, Elliot Minor, You Me At Six and The Sunshine Underground amongst others. <br /><br />The band are currently recording their debut album with Headroom Productions (who have previously worked with artists such as Kaiser Chiefs, Motion City Soundtrack, Grammatics and The Pigeon Detectives), after winning a competition decided by public vote, beating thousands of other bands in the process. The competition was run by www.Slicethepie.com. <br /><br />Jagermeister have noticed the promise and potential of Armstrong and invited them to join their roster of sponsored bands, which includes artists such as Bullet For My Valentine and Fightstar. <br /><br />Visit the band's website www.ArmstrongRock.com to purchase T-shirts, bags, tickets, CDs and other goodies.<br /><br />"A tornado of infectious pop-rock melodies" - Kerrang!<br /><br />"The Killers, The Foo Fighters and The Libertines all rolled into one - great rock riffs combined with keyboards, fast drumming, intelligent lyrics along with bundles of energy" - BBC Leeds<br /><br />"Intelligent, tuneful and IKEA flat-packed with stadium sing-alongs. Awesome. Dude." - Vibrations Magazine - Leeds<br /><br />"Far too ballsy to fit the emo bracket...epic rock that will take this band from the toilet circuit right to stadium headliners" - Moderate Rock <br /><br />"With a show as energy driven as this one and with the talent these five have combined, I can see them going far" - RoomThirteen.com<br /><br />"Melodic, anthemic punk pop" - The Vanity Project Fanzine<br /><br />"Armstrong could enjoy the same success as Arctic Monkeys" - Oxford Mail <br /><br />"A young Rock band who have energy and enthusiasm and an understanding of melody." - Cool Noise <br /><br />"Armstrong's high-octane performance managed to touch the soul, warm the heart, invigorate the mind and move the body." - LSRfm<br /><br />"The most energetic bunch of musicians I've ever seen" - The Beat Surrender.</p>
