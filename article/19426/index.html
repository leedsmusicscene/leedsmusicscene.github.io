    <p>Leeds-based indie-rockers The Brazen will release their anthemic new single Burn It Down on Friday 25th March. The single is the first track to be taken from their upcoming debut album and cements the blueprint of the band's sound - soaring vocals, interweaving guitar riffs and pounding drums.<br /><br />Since forming in early 2015, the five-piece have been tearing up venues around Leeds and picking up fans at every gig. United by shared influences & musical cornerstones The Stone Roses, Queen & The Who, their combination of classic rock sounds and Britpop melodies has impressed both local audiences and other bands on the scene. <br /><br />The boys' debut album was recorded with talented producer Ed Heaton (production credits include Jon Gomm, Fold, Ellen & The Escapades & more) at the beginning of 2016 and is set for a summer release. With a string of sold out shows and a performance at Elland Road already under their belt, 2016 will be a great year for The Brazen.<br /><br />The band will be celebrating the release of Burn It Down and the new album with the following headline live dates - <br /><br />27th May - Leeds, Milo<br />3rd June - Sheffield, Maida Vale<br />23rd July - Birmingham, Actress & Bishop</p>
