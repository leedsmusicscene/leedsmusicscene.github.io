    <p>South Wales born singer songwriter Ridley Barbet began her singing career in York, North Yorkshire, in early 2007. Her music has been described to be an indie/pop/folk fusion.<br /><br />In October 2009 she released her first EP titled '3 songs'. Each song shows different styles of her song writing talents. The EP was released through a Yorkshire label, Confidential Records Ltd.<br /><br />Ridley has played in many venues over north England including The Well, Leeds, the New Oxford, Salford, the Basement, York, and many more.<br /><br />Shattered Glass Media, Leeds, and Khaos Media, York, have been supportive of Ridley's career from day one and have published reviews and produced great quality live music videos.<br /><br />She has also has the pleasure of playing with a wide variety of acts, including former front man from inME, Dave Mcphearson, electro rock band Kassius, ska punk band Second Chance and folk singer Edwina Hayes. She has also collaborated on the odd occasion with singers such as Jimmy Docorty , Martin Wainwrite and Steve O'gallager, to produce last minute live duos which have proved popular.<br /><br />Recently she has had the support from The Fox's Den, Vixen 101 Fm and Tempo Fm, where she has done two live broadcasts this year. With the recent formation of her band she will be aiming to play at her first line up of festivals this year, the first one being Surface Unsigned in April which will be the launch of her new folk ska band..</p>
