    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2008.</p>
    <p>Following glowing reviews for his debut album ‘Mindfilming’, Leeds songwriter Simon Bristoll aka Captain Wilberforce returns with a new Album - ‘Everyone Loves a Villain’ - available free to members of Leeds Music Forum website.<br><br>Anyone can register with the site within seconds for free, and from 16th March, can download a full copy of the album (which will get its formal national CD release in June 2008).  The free download deal runs until 30th March. There’ll even be an acoustic Captain Wilberforce gig to celebrate the launch at the Primrose on Sunday 23rd March.<br><br>Simon ranks Elvis Costello, The Beatles and US alt-pop pioneers Guided By Voices high in his huge list of influences and the new album reflects this with infectious tunes, clever wordplay and an ear for an exceptional middle 8!  The new album was recorded “across bedrooms in Leeds” and yet has the veneer of a major label release thanks to Leeds based production maestro Carl Rosamond.<br><br>“This is a fantastic opportunity for me to get my songs out to people who really love music and discuss it every day.  Leeds Music Forum is the busiest local music community site in the UK with almost 4,000 members and over 3,000 posts a week.  Over the last few years, home grown Leeds music heroes such as Kaiser Chiefs, Pigeon Detectives and Forward Russia have regularly posted on the forum and more than likely you’ll find the next big thing is already making waves on the message-boards,” Simon said.<br><br>Once registered and signed into the forum, send a private message to CaptainW (by clicking this link) to get the link to your free album download file.<br><br>So come on in, sign up and join in the chat (and get a free album while you're there!).</p>
