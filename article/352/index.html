        <h1>The Horror - First Blood</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "First Blood" recorded by The Horror. The review was written by Paul Geary in 2003.</p>
    <p>Leeds-based The Horror have a legacy most UK hardcore acts could only wish for, with ex-members of Leeds seminal hardcore act Voorhees and with a frontman from the mighty Imbalance. This 10" release on Chainsaw Safety was eagerly awaited (well by me anyway).<br><br>Well, where to begin, this is BRUTAL, this is everything a fan of Thrash/Hardcore could want. Great lyrics not the usual pessimistic, bleak stuff we so often see but some very witty and intelligent social commentaries... (check out "Fuck the Romans" I think this is supposed to be tongue in cheek?!)<br><br>Backbreakingly tight, this drummer is as sharp as an intravenous canular. Great riffs, again super tight (think of Out Cold in a fistfight with Severed Head of State). Add a great production from Pat Grogan, and top it off with good artwork and lyrics sheet et Voila! A corker of a record.<br><br>Best song? - "Attack Ships on Fire"<br>Worse Bit? - Too Short<br><br>What piece of office furniture would this band be? The sharp corner of a late 80's gun metal grey filing cabinet.<br><br>Great record: aggressive, eclectic, and tight. Fills the hole in UK hardcore that was left when Voorhees called it day.</p>
