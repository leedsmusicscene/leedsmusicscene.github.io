    <p>Now it is the turn of Matt Bradshaw, Jumbo Records Local Product Specialist, to give us his view on what is selling and making waves from the West Yorkshire region.  Check out his pick of the local artists for May and if you like what you hear, get to a gig or drop in to Jumbo and pick yourself up home-grown talent.<br /><br />THE SEE NO EVILS - We Are Strangers E.P.  ( 7")<br /><br />We start off with a scorching hot release (so hot we've sold dozens of copies in just a few months) which flares with super-catchy power-pop/60's garage-influenced magic and has a 'dancing round the room' pied piper-ness about it! We expect big things from them and they're already getting some nice support slots. Hook-laden, passionate and worthy of reaching a wider audience... <br /><br /><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/50322659&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_artwork=true"></iframe> <br /><br />GALAXIANS - Self Titled E.P. (12") Rotating Souls<br /><br />Another band that are bubbling way out beyond the Leeds scene (and like The See No Evils we had them do an in-store for us), the Galaxians are slowly taking over the boogie-down universe (and Pittsburgh in the U.S.) with a synth-y slickness that takes in disco, 80's electro and sleazy cosmic oozy boogie! Built around feet-moving percussion this WILL have you moving toward the dance-floor in no time... <br /><br /><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/127775461&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_artwork=true"></iframe><br /><br />GIRL ONE AND THE GREASE GUNS - No Longer Spellbound ( 7") Squirrel Records<br /><br />Creamy dreamy lushness that caresses you into an addictive cycle of wanting to play this over and over...It's got an almost soundtrack quality to it too with breathlessly beautiful vocals over a cavernous keyboard-scape augmented by subtle guitar licks. This mystery band is formed from some semi-legendary Leeds lads and lasses that have grafted their take on the perfect indie-pop sound... <br /><br /><br />Your browser does not support the audio element.
