        <h1>Tempting Kate - Waiting For Nothing</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Waiting For Nothing" recorded by Tempting Kate. The review was written by Dave Sugden in 2001.</p>
    <p>Three-piece Tempting Kate are a Scotland-based band with a Garforth contact address - drummer Paul is from Leeds - but even the most tenuous Leeds-link is acceptable as far as I am concerned because these guys have sent me a top-class CD with four excellent guitar-pop tracks.  I haven't even tried to turn it off, and if they fail to get national recognition it will be a major travesty.  Yes, really, I am that excited about this CD.  And so what if I'm jumping on the bandwagon - ok, so YEP gave them 5/5, over 600 copies of this record have been shipped already and they got rave reviews from national music press - I'm now joining that list.<br><Br>The band say "Sonic Pop" which sounds cool, if you want to know what this is like think the poppy aspects of Idlewild, the ability to play happy-go-pop guitar music and still keep a certain crunch and credibility at the same time.  Think Feeder.  Think tracks that very easily compare well to the two recent Feeder singles.  Think radio-friendly.  Think kids that pogo, jump around and have lots of fun. Think infectious. Wow. Can't wait to see if they can do this live.</p>
