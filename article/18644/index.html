    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for The Robotz.</p>
    <p>After the departure of two founding members in 2011, the two remaining members, Finn and Tom redirected their influences from the guitar bands they'd been rooted in and moved in favour of a different range of influences stemming from their love of hip hop. By fusing beats and basslines of classic hip hop with chords and melodies of modern guitar music, The Robotz quickly amassed a huge amount of original material, however, marred by the lack of a drummer and guitarist, were limited to purely writing and recording, unable to play live with just two members. In mid-2014 they went into the studio to record their first EP, 'The Now Now EP' which, despite not being an accurate representation of their desired sound, proved to be a valuable and educative experience. As the end of 2014 approached, The Robotz were joined in quick succession by Owen 'Wren' O'Reilly and George Wybrow to complete the quartet. On the 2nd of January 2015 the band recorded two brand new songs with Thom Balmforth of the band White Royal producing. The songs will be released as a double A side demo, soon to be followed by another three track demo EP - which combined, will form the first five tracks of a fifteen track mixtape to be released early this year.<br /><br />Finn Smith - Vocals, Guitars, Bass, Keys<br />Tam Hain - Vocals, Guitars, Bass, Keys<br />Wren O'Reilly - Vocals, Guitars, Bass, Keys<br />George Wybrow - Vocals, Drums, Percussion.</p>
