    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2010.</p>
    <p>Laid-back soul songwriter Hollie Sheard has released a new single from her upcoming album "By Hook Or By Crook". The A-side song is an emotional ballad called "All Here", and the B-side choice was made by her online community of fans, who listened to clips of songs from the new album and voted for their favourites. The firm overall favourite was the dark horse "Moving On" - a simple piano/vocal song which snared 52% of votes. The single also contains a third bonus song, which is a live track that was recorded by Hollie Sheard & Friends during a performance underneath a railway arch last year.<br /><br />The single is on sale for £2 through the Hollie Sheard & Friends online shop at their official website (www.holliesheard.co.uk) and is being sold to raise funds towards the cost of mastering and manufacturing their new album.<br /><br />Hollie Sheard & Friends are also hoping to book some live performances in the next few months to promote the album, and would love to hear from interested promoters and venue representatives in West and South Yorkshire.</p>
