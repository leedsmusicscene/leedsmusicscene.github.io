    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2003.</p>
    <p>Leeds guitar rock band Xi - known for casting more than a passing nod in the direction of Metal and Goth - have been invited to support Spear of Destiny at Scarborough's shortly-to-open venue The Kazbah on Sunday March 30th.<br><br>With eleven out of fifteen possible dates on Xi's Easter tour now confirmed - including a show at The Kazbah - the band have been contacted by the venue's promoters and asked to take the Spear support as well, even though it is less than two weeks before their tour date.<br><br>Xi manager Steve Kind of Panama Promotions said:<br><br>"No Code Promotions rang me out of the blue this week to say they'd been listening to demo tracks and thought Xi would be ideal for the Spear of Destiny support. I pointed out that we were due to play The Kazbah only two weeks later, but they said that wasn't a problem. It's not the sort of offer you can refuse!"<br><br>The band are hoping to organise a ticket-and-travel deal for Leeds fans of Spear of Destiny and Xi - and as a bonus may offer free admission to the Xi tour launch gig headlined by Her Alibi at the Royal Park Cellars to everyone who buys a ticket for the Scarborough gig from them.<br><br>Once the support slot is out of the way, Xi launch their tour proper with a gig at the Royal Park Cellars on Thursday 10th April headlined by Her Alibi.</p>
