    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for Mr Gary C.</p>
    <p>You could sum up Mr Gary C's career to date by saying he's "been there, done that and worn the t-shirt!" As both an accomplished musician and songwriter, his credentials include UK Independent Chart and UK Commercial Club Chart top 10 success, songs featured on MTV, Channel 4, Sky Sports, surfing DVDs and computer games, daytime radio-play across the UK, USA, Germany and Australia, being an in-house songwriter for an independent record label, and having a song considered by the musical director of a James Bond movie. <br /><br />Mr Gary C has worked with a number of top producers, and had versions of his songs remixed by the likes of Ode Hunte (Leona Lewis), Seed (Cascada) and Justin Harris (Acid House). His song writing talents were recently recognised by the International Songwriters Association, who featured an in-depth interview with him in their worldwide magazine. His more recent and varied exploits include a project with eternal pop stars Right Said Fred and penning an opening song for BBC Radio Leeds' "Leeds United Unplugged" show. <br /><br />His guitar playing skills have seen him sharing the bill with Sugababes, Richard Hawley, The View, Rose Royce and Corinne Bailey Rae, to name but a few. <br /><br />When some might be considering hanging up their instrument, putting away their dictionary and thesaurus, and looking back on what they've achieved, Mr Gary C has turned his attention to the acoustic scene and is having the time of his life! His forte is well crafted and upbeat songs, which are full of hooks and are instantly memorable. Drawing from such influences as Bobby Darin, "Rubber Soul" era Beatles, and the Baccarach & David partnership, he performs with bags of style and with a confidence that has earning him a reputation as "must see" act. Within a short space of time Mr Gary C has notched up a number of fantastic live shows and radio appearances... all whilst playing the type of music he loves and with a smile on his face!.</p>
