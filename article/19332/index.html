    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Adult" recorded by Blacklisters. The review was written by Hayleyyyyy in 2015.</p>
    <p>Released on 18 September 2015 by Leeds based Blacklisters, Adult, the 10 song album starts off well but doesn't have enough punch to keep me interested.<br /><br />The opening track, SHIRTS, starts with an almost Boards of Canada / Skullflower noise feel and moves into a driving, simple beat with intense vocals.  CASHCOW has a change of pace and feeling of late 90s Deftones, but along with THE SADNESS OF AXL ROSE, the tracks just seem to wane in energy. <br /><br />That said, BIG TICKER is my favourite song from the album, with lots of layers and texture. Although it's a slower, and less aggressive song, it's intricate and interesting. However, the rest of the songs on Adult I find to be generally unremarkable, aside from DREAMBOAT, which is the saving grace on the last half of the album. It has a slightly more subdued feel compared to the other songs and I like the repetitive theme.<br /><br />I have a feeling that Blacklisters would be a fantastic band to see live and to understand them better. They're obviously an intense, energetic group but to me, their music doesn't transmit well to CD without having seen a live performance.<br /><br />Watch Shirts here: <br /><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SpsfkOGfPS8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
