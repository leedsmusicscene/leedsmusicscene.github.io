    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2011.</p>
    <p>Stunted Records have released 'residual hum from a parallel universe' by SomewhereNotHere, the solo project from ex FULC guitarist Rik Clay.<br /> <br />With an experimental electronic vibe not dissimilar to a latter day "Low" era Bowie, the tracks on this album were born in 2006 and are being released now, two and a half years after Rik's sad death in 2008.<br /> <br />An album of two halves, the first CD being "Memorial", a collection of tracks that Rik recorded as part of his SomewhereNotHere project, the second CD being "Tribute", which sees vocal collaborations on Rik's work by Owen Brinley (Colour of Fire / Grammatics), Chris Catalyst (Eureka Machines / Sisters of Mercy) and Michelle Richfield (Sear / Anathema) as well as tribute tracks specifically recorded for the project by Martin Grech, Vessels and Fiction and the Fear (Rik's former band mates from Ten Seconds of Chaos).<br /><br />The double album digipak is rounded off by a couple of rare FULC recordings and three videos on the enhanced "Tribute" CD.<br /> <br />A musical snapshot, that barely scratches the surface of where Rik was taking his music with SomewhereNotHere, this album forms a portable memorial for anyone who wants to delve into the music of this enigmatic character.<br /><br />"residual hum from a parallel universe" by SomewhereNotHere was released on digital download format on Monday 23rd May 2011, and will be available physically in double album digipak format on Monday 13th June 2011.</p>
