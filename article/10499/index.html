        <h1>Pat Bourne Band - Untitled</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Untitled" recorded by Pat Bourne Band. The review was written by Jessica Thornsby in 2009.</p>
    <p>'Touch & Go' boasts a solid chorus of hooky, if a little easy, lyrics, and soulful vocals courtesy of frontman Pat Bourne, topped off with the occasional, disco-infused synth. This catchy, but pretty run-of-the-mill, indie-rock is given some additional character thanks to a handful of bluesy chords, which make for a particularly hook-laden bridge section.<br /><br />  'Mind, Body & Soul' puts a poppier, boyband spin on Bourne's vocals. Against this song's twinkling melodies and pleasantly clunky acoustic guitar, the borderline-cheesy vocals actually provide 'Mind, Body & Soul' with the majority of its hooks. Chances are you'll find yourself tapping your foot along to this piece of pop-infused funkiness, even if it won't leave you completely bowled over.<br /><br />  'Every Dog Has Its Day' is built on a funky underlying groove that's emphasised by some very slick drumbeats. The understated cool of this song perfectly showcases Pat's rich, soulful voice, and you can't help but be impressed.<br /><br />  However, this song is musically repetitive and, even if The Pat Bourne Band do attempt to inject some variety into proceedings with keyboard flourishes and sections of rougher riffs, this four minute long slog is likely to test your patience.<br /><br />  The Pat Bourne Band bring their EP to a close in unusual fashion, with an acoustic version of 'Just A Phase I'm Going Through' performed live on Radio Leeds. Happily, this inclusion confirms that Pat's vocals are just as good live as they are on record. With 'Just A Phase I'm Going Through' he may not be reaching for any awkward notes, and he may be guilty of singing at the same level for the whole of the song, but this seems to be because he knows what he excels at, and he sticks to it.<br /><br />  This four track EP reveals some definite strengths; The Pat Bourne Band have an intriguingly-voiced frontman, an ear for the subtly groovy tune, and an apparent fascination with bluesy/funk leanings that could make for a very distinctive sounding band. However, what this E.P is lacking is that stand-out track or hook that would keep the listener coming back for more. That frustratingly elusive extra something is what's missing from this EP. <br /><br />  With this recording The Pat Bourne Band have laid some solid foundations, they just won't have the masses sitting up and paying attention, quite yet.</p>
