    <p>With the Leeds Festival 2010 line up announced at the end of March, and with the summer just around the corner, it can only mean one thing. That's right: it is that time of year again for local promoters Futuresound to announce it is offering six Yorkshire bands the opportunity to appear at the prestigious annual event. <br /><br />Now into its tenth year, the annual Futuresound competition is a regular fixture on the Leeds music scene calendar, and this year promises to be the biggest battle of the bands yet with 40 bands - instead of the usual 30 - to be given the opportunity to battle it out to be one of the six acts who will each win a slot at the Leeds and Reading Festival this year. <br /><br />The overall winner of Futuresound 2010 will play on the Festival Republic Stage at both Leeds and Reading Festivals and the five runners-up will also get the opportunity to play at both festivals on the BBC Introducing Stage. <br /><br />The overall winner will also receive Â£500.<br /><br />Futuresound promoter Andy Smith said on the official Cockpit blog today, "This competition is a great opportunity which is often the stepping stone to bigger things. Last year we saw a huge amount of top quality entrants with the likes of Middleman, Wonderswan and Chickenhawk coming in the top six acts and hopefully this year will prove to be even better."<br /><br />Rules stipulate that bands must be from the Yorkshire region, with bands in Harrogate and York also being invited to take part this year. <br /><br />Anyone interested in applying should register their interest by downloading an application form from the Cockpit website. <br /><br />Once the 40 bands are selected - from the hundreds of expected entrants - the competition proper will take place at the Cockpit in Leeds on 10 dates running from the end of June and over the course of July. Each night will feature four bands and will be judged by a live audience vote, as all heats are open to the public, as well as three judges from within the Leeds music industry. <br /><br />The deadline for entries is Friday 4th June.</p>
