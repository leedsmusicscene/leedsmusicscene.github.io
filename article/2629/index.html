        <h1>Kenosha - One Percenter</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "One Percenter" recorded by Kenosha. The review was written by Richard Garnett in 2004.</p>
    <p>[Having received this CD second hand from another reviewer and then promptly forgotten about it, this review begins with an apology for the delay... the wrist has been slapped I assure you]<bR><br>Kenosha have a sound well worth investigation. Pulling all the right poses and flexing all the right musical muscle they have adeptly cooked up a rock blend that is earnest, gritty, inventive and most importantly tricky to compare. Reviewers (myself included) feel very uncomfortable when bands land a CD on them that they can't instantly pigeon-hole, all our power is drained and we melt in a puddle of frustration.<br><br>This two song offering is by no means in the "never been done before" territory but any influences are well disguised - think Dinosaur JR plays Free covers sticking in the odd EMO melody, having had a lecture on the recent merits of "angular" and a master class of "double tracked harmonising lead vocals - ref The 70's"... got it? Didn't think so. "One Percenter" is a grinding bass driven stomp-a-long interspersed with plenty of quick witted stops and pace changes. The slightly muddy production and the wealth of ideas ultimately holds it back and it isn't until the much simpler construction "Stop sign" that the bands clear ear for melody begins to shine through.<bR><br>Just the two songs but plenty of promise - long may they thwart reviewers everywhere.</p>
