    <p>It’s Red Bull Music Academy time again – which means that aspiring DJs, producers and musicians hoping to attend the inspirational sessions in Toronto this autumn should get their applications into www.redbullmusicacademy.com pronto.  The application phase starts on 23rd March and closes on 4th May.<br><br>Since launching in 1998 The Red Bull Music Academy has touched down as far a field as Seattle, Sao Paulo, Cape Town and Melbourne bringing together like minded people with diverse musical knowledge and backgrounds from around the globe in a cultural exchange of experiences, ideas and stories.<br><br>Each year two groups of thirty participants are accepted into the Academy and are joined by a broad spectrum of music professionals each for a fortnight term. Topics cover everything from music history to technology, interspersed with the incredible and inspirational tales of the guest lectures who range from musical legends like Bob Moog or The Mizell Brothers to 20-year old dubstep DJ Skream. Each day workshops take place in fully equipped practice/recording studios kitted out with the latest music production software and in the evening participants play out their gigs in the best clubs around town.<br><br>Prospective applicants have an opportunity to experience a day at the Academy during four free (first come, first served) ‘Info Sessions’ being run at four locations in the UK. London 20th April at the Roundhouse, Leeds 23rd April at Mine, Glasgow, 18th April at Sub Club and Birmingham on 26th April at The Old Library.  Each session will feature workshops with guest lecturers such as Four Tet (London), Greg Wilson (Leeds), Alex Smoke (Glasgow) and Waajeed (Platinum Pies Pipers, Detroit) in Birmingham to name a few.<br><br>For those who can’t make it to an infosession, Red Bull Music Academy Radio goes ‘On-Demand’ from April 10th giving access anytime to over 500 exclusive shows. Aiming to become one of the biggest music archives and webradios on the net the 24/7 station offers exclusive mixes, live feeds, tribute sets, guest DJ’s and interviews, as well as lecture podcasts from some of the Academy’s most inspirational guests.</p>
