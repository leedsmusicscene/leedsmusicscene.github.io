    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for Leatherhead.</p>
    <p>Leatherhead is a hard rock band with industrial overtones, and also some stripped down acoustic elements. They are based in the Leeds, West Yorkshire area in the UK.<br /><br />They are primarily made up of Steve Wilson (vocals, bass guitar) and Daniel Millikin (guitars). Other musicians are brought in as need be. Mike Thrussell sits in on drums/percussion when a full band set up is required, but they also play a lot of shows as an unplugged, acoustic act. <br /><br />They have been developing their style and sound over the last 10+ years, drawing from such influences as: Nine Inch Nails, Soundgarden, Pearl Jam, Nirvana, Rage Against the Machine, Days of the New, Audioslave, Alice in Chains, Temple of the Dog and many more. <br /><br />Steve Writes the songs and both he and Dan work on arrangements. They have been working very hard over the last year to finish their debut album "losing Faith"¬ù which will be available very soon and contains 12 all original tracks. <br /><br />Having spent a lot of time playing local gigs in and around the Leeds area, they now feel it is time to branch out and try to get their music heard by as many people as possible. The music is honest and passionate and can be at times dark and powerful.<br /><br />The band is very ambitious and believes they have what it takes to make music that will resonate with anyone who hears it..</p>
