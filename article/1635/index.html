    <p>Following the many successes and disasters of one of Leeds' finest ever pop groups LANDSPEED LOUNGERS, Dave Cooke left the group to take stock of his life. Dave decided that a steady career as a Ceramic Artist specialising in sculpting life-size penguins was not enough to assuage his hunger for the absurd, so after a short period of time with his head in the clouds, Dave emerged triumphantly sporting a large, ungainly papier-mache aeroplane head-piece and a freshly twanged guitar in his hand. <br /><br />He declared himself Being 747.<br /><br />The next few months were spent lulling acoustic and folk-night audiences into a false sense of security before bamboozling them with unpredictable, choppy melodies and twisted-perspectives on everyday matter, whether they be profound, mundane or downright surreal. All of which were delivered with Dave's unmistakable baritone through the mouthpiece of his giant prosthetic aeroplane head.<br /><br />Such eccentricity was bound to attract attention from the like-minded. And so, in the middle of 2001, Dave was approached by siblings Steven & Paul Morricone from well-established art rock behemoth, THE SCARAMANGA SIX, who offered to add a bit of muscle to the proceedings. Paul assumed the unfamiliar role of drummer, whilst Steven tackled the other roles of organ & bass - preferably at the same time. All three members embarked on a voyage of the utterly awkward, each constantly challenging themselves with their array of new-found toys. The now dynamic and completely un-acoustic BEING 747 were ready to take off with the aim to astound, confuse and bemuse through the medium of pop music.<br /><br />Being 747's dreamy debut EP 'Weathergirl' was released in the spring of 2002 on Wrath Records to a generally disbelieving press. How could something so beautiful, well-crafted and pre-meditated come from some tiny DIY label in Leeds? Dave Cooke was perceived as some kind of 'Smoking jacketed Noel Coward of Indiedom', despite his collection of comfortable sweaters. A fair amount of plays on various national, local and web-based radio stations later and Being 747 had made their mark.<br /><br />Thanks to a growing reputation as an entertaining oddball outfit who'll turn up at the last minute and play for peanuts - some plum supports (The Fall, Cinerama). They've also supported a number of bands who - at the time - would have played for peanuts, but who have since gone on to sell bucket loads ie: Kaiser Chiefs, Maximo Park, The Cribs. <br /><br />Eventually (and this may take some time) we shall eclipse then all with our ramshackle and 'difficult to pigeon hole' pop ... but don't hold your breath..</p>
