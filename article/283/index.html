        <h1>The Lost 45s UK - We Were Storming</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "We Were Storming" recorded by The Lost 45s UK. The review was written by Sam Saunders in 2003.</p>
    <p>So. Three quick tracks, blasted out in double quick time to give the punters a taste of what's in store. No EQ finesse, no studio agony. But three mighty hooky songs with a fairly astonishing grasp of the pop song form. There's a rasping voice (Nige Spence) and a beaty punky infectious combo (Dave Fairbrother drums, Mick Ward, keyboards, Nick Waters guitar) rattling along like a good 'un. It's like a lift from something that was too good to go on a mod oriented album from 1965. It's also very fresh and bursting with NOW confidence. Don't take my word for it. Get along to the Royal Park Cellars on May 24th and listen to the Dizzy Miss Lizzy bass line on "Thursday/Friday/Saturday/Sunday" (Spence again). Have a chuckle at the Fiddler on the Roof/I Will Survive trickery of town drunk song "Billy" or the Ronettes drum intro to the classic "beat ballad" of "We were Storming" with Geno Washington bass. Put a grin on your face and dance like a fool. Woo hoo, as a famous drumming sister regularly says. Buy the demo if they'll let you have a copy and start saving up for the vinyl.<br><br>The Lost 45s sound like a band who have done their bloody homework and who are more than ready to give you a good night out.</p>
