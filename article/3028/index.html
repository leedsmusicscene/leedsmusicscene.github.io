    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for Antony Arcuri.</p>
    <p>Antony Arcuri began writing and recording music in 2005, with the support of his friends and family Antony began to study a BA (Hons) degree in music production at the University of Huddersfield in 2008.<br /><br />At the Huddersfield campus Antony was introduced to drummer Spencer Lee. Spencer was already established on the local scene through playing in the metal band Eyesore Angels. Following their introduction Spencer was asked to perform on the new Arcuri demo 'The disaster project'.<br /><br />Spencer Lee played a key role in the production of the demo and introduced Antony to producer Dave Lawson. Lawson lends his skills in terms of recording, production and mixing, he also arranged all instrumentation on the recordings.<br /><br />Arcuri, Lee and Lawson began talks to distinguish what type of sound the demo should encapsulate. Arcuri had been playing a lot of acoustic gigs in and around Huddersfield and the initial pitch for the demo was an acoustic album.<br /><br />Meanwhile Arcuri had joined a guitar improvisation group at the University campus. It was here that he met guitarist James Hemmings. Hemmings had an immeasurable talent on the lead guitar and it wasn't long until he was introduced to the other members.<br /><br />After recording the initial drum sessions the acoustic idea was scrapped and the quartet set out to record a good solid pop record. After experimenting with different song structures and melodies the demo began to take shape and 'The disaster project' was born..</p>
