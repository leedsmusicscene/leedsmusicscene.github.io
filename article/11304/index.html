    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for Bearfoot Beware.</p>
    <p>E: bearfootbeware@gmail.com W: www.bearfootbeware.co.uk<br /><br />"...awesome, a musical shot in the arm for anyone losing faith in what modern guitar bands are capable of... uniquely inventive punchy mathpunk." -  Schlur<br /><br />Energetic and scrappy, Bearfoot Beware are an alt rock power trio from Leeds. <br /><br />Formed, when guitarist and vocalist Tom Bradley and bassist Ric Vowden bonded over their shared love of 90s American hardcore punk and the math rock scene of the time, the line-up was completed by drummer Mike Osborne. <br /><br />Clashing and merging the elemental characteristics of math and noise, with an uncanny propensity for a catchy tune, their EP 'Bruises And Business', made available under the radar last year, on Nottingham based Mountains Of Records, now sees a full release in the run up to their debut long-player, planned for April 2015 release.<br /><br />Bearfoot Beware have festival slots at Reading & Leeds, British Wildlife and Live At Leeds under their belt; they will play selected shows this autumn/winter with a full UK tour planned for next March/April.<br /><br />With rhythms that propel the limbs but boggle the mind, the group are steadily building a name for themselves with their brand of explosive and unpredictable skullduggery.<br /><br /><br />"Bearfoot Beware are characterised as much by tough, tight playing as by their deliciously devious songwriting. Wall-of- sound energy, sly intelligence and subversive arrangements keep the musical surprises coming. What's not to like?" - Tom Robinson, 6 Music.</p>
