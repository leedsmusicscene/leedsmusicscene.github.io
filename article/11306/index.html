    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for South View Juniors.</p>
    <p>South View Juniors are an indie band from Leeds, West Yorkshire.<br /><br />Influenced by bands ranging from The Beatles to Doves. Formed in 2007 the band  comprises of Ben Stanhope (Vocals), Andy Young (Lead Guitar+Vocals), Jon Stanhope (Rhythm Guitar), Adam Prince (Bass Guitar), Pete Love (Drums)<br /><br />South View Juniors are Five friends all originally from a small town called Yeadon, near Leeds. The band write all their own material and formed in late 2007. They started out as a three piece, playing acoustically in and around the area, but soon became a five piece. The name comes from a former Junior school on Rufford Avenue in Yeadon, which some of the lads went to in the late 80s & early 90s. <br /><br />"The Dark Arches of Leeds reverberated to the chants of SVJ as Yeadon band South View Juniors produced a storming set as they headlined the nearby Cockpit venue for the first time. This band is fast making a move on the local music scene and, unlike many others who have been content to remain on the continual grind of the usual Leeds venues such as Joseph's Well, The New Roscoe, Rios and The Cockpit and not spread their wings, SVJ are grabbing every new experience they can. South View Juniors have that indefinable 'something different' that is setting them apart from many of the other bands on the circuit and is building them a big reputation." <br />BBC Leeds<br /><br />"Finally, it's South View Juniors turn to take the stage. The venue is nearly full now so everybody's hoping that this band's going to be worth the wait. And SVJ deliver. They've had to follow some very good bands tonight but these guys have lived up to the task set for them. They have a great set at their disposal, and know how to use it. The venue doesn't allow much stage presence, but the music coming off it more than accounts for the lack of energy."<br />Sandman Magazine.</p>
