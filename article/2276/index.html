    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2004.</p>
    <p>Oddball, jerky pop whatnots Being 747 are about to embark on a voyage of quite ordinary proportions as they tour the country up and down and then back up again very quickly. Why do they put themselves through such torment? - well the answer is to support the release of their fantastic debut album. That's why.<Br><Br>So then, more about this 'ere album of theirs. It's called Fun & Games and contains a staggering 13 chunks of legs-in-the-air goofyness. The much-anticipated debut album (by their Mums anyway) details amongst other things the trials and tribulations of the music industry and everyday social realism with a huge dollop of eloquence & cynicism. Whilst flitting about between the musical genres of IndiePop, No-Wave, Alt-Country, and Garage Rockabilly like some kind of rampant moth, this album also explores a variety of instrumentation and arrangement from the minimal and spacious to the downright lavish. Confused? - you will be.<br><br>Monday March 8th is the date you need to etch on your cranial membranes - for this is the momentous day that some copies of this fine work will be in some shops somewhere. Oh yes. Those of you allergic to shops, but rather fond of the online selling capabilities of the interweb can get hold of it at www.oxfordmusic.net or there is a third way - good old trusty Wrath mail order. See the products page for details on how to order.<Br><br>BARGAIN ALERT: It should be worth noting that the first 100 mail orders through for Fun & Games will get a totally free copy of Being 747's dreamy Weathergirl EP with it. How can you refuse that, eh?<br><br>A handful of gigs will also be occurring, including a Leeds show on Saturday 14th February at The Vine.</p>
