    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2003.</p>
    <p>From Friday 18th July to Saturday 16th August, Leeds will host Rhythms of the City, an event that involves street acts from around the world performing throughout the city centre. Part of this event is the world famous Spiegeltent, which will be located on Millennium Square from Thursday 17th July to Saturday 26th July.<Br><br>For many years the Spiegeltent has been one of the principal venues of the Edinburgh Festival, with its antique mirrored ballroom interior dating from the 1920's.  The Leeds dates will feature a 10-day programme of comedy and music performance staged in Leeds prior to the Edinburgh Festival.<Br><br>The 500-capacity venue will be open each day between 11am-11pm (with free access and performances until 6.00pm).  Each evening it transforms itself into a unique cabaret venue (two performances at 7.30pm and 9.30pm). Ticket prices will vary between £2-£10.<Br><br>Live music will include sets from Bodixa, The Yards, Wildcats of Kilkenny, Abba Forever, Chumbawamba, and many more.<Br><br>Further information is available at www.spiegeltent.net.</p>
