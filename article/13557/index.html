        <h1>Sketches - 1 of 200</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "1 of 200" recorded by Sketches. The review was written by Richard Sykes in 2010.</p>
    <p>Sketches new EP, '1 of 200,' is the latest self-distributed limited CD by the Leeds-based indie-pop quartet, and if you check their previous LMS reviews it has a lot to live up to, with their first 2 singles getting 10/10 and 9/10 reviews.<br /><br />The opener, 'Sycophants With Style' is expansive, intelligent guitar music. It's in a similar vein to Wild Beasts with the anthemic repeated falsetto refrain of "Oh mother, misery suits you" giving it a touch of stadium-rock epic-ness, but in a slightly more restrained and controlled, British way. Perfect pop single length at 3 and a half minutes (as with both of the other tracks on here), the only thing I wanted to do after it finished was press the back button to hear it again.<br /><br />Next up,'Your God Gave Me Lemons' is a touch more down-beat with a rockier rhythm guitar. Strong vocals, a big repetitive sing-along chorus and builds up to a crescendo with chiming guitar before slowing to the finish.<br /><br />Finally, 'Softly Into Our Graves' will also appeal to fans of Wild Beasts, starting with Sketches apparently signature delay guitar plucking and vocal, then kicking off into a strong drum-led verse but softening into the chorus. Not quite the loud-quiet-loud of bands like the Pixies but interesting and making the "Softly, softly into our graves" all the more effective.<br /><br />I am happy to confirm that this one also hits the right buttons leaving you wanting more and is a worthy follow-up to the wonderful 'Bleed Victoria'. This along with their live performances will continue to win them fans and on the strength of the first 3 releases, I can't wait for their album.</p>
