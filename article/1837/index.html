    <p>Rob Galloway was raised in West Leeds; He cites Joe Strummer, Beck, and Nine Inch Nails as his biggest musical influences. He played his very first gig at Trinity and All Saints College in Horsforth on 24th September 2003, Initially acoustic Rob played countless solo gigs throughout 2003-2005 sometimes pairing with local singer Davinia Dyson. Rob decided to drop the acoustic guitar in May 2005 for the Boot Music compilation, which featured a very punk effort “42nd Street”. July 2005 saw Rob’s first electric set at Manchester’s Dry Bar, showcasing a brand new sound … Dance Beats, Guitars, Trip Hop, Punk Rock, Beck meets Iggy Pop. Rob then went to play out the rest of the year at gigs in Leeds including one at Carpe Diem which he decided to promote with his friend Cav, It was a fund raiser for the St Gemma’s Hospice, the all dayer featuring nearly twenty local acts managed to raise &pound;1,000 and was rewarded with a feature in the Yorkshire Evening Post. By April 2006 Rob was invited to play the main support slot at the HMV/Kerrang Showcase at Josephs Well, one review described the set “It's like he is offering a soundtrack to an imaginary movie” – Rob reckons its more like a soundtrack to his life! This gig also coincided with a limited release of his first cd “I Love … I Live” selling all 50 copies almost immediately; Vibrations Magazine said, “The likeable Rob Galloway has unquestionable integrity. His voice cracks with passion and soars with authentic honesty”. Also that month “Business Suits” found its way onto the second Boot Music compilation. In July Rob was approached by Strummerville (The Joe Strummer Foundation of New Music) to play a benefit gig in 2007. August saw the debut of a video backdrop into his set showing off some of the sights of his beloved city integrated with past live footage, Also whilst attending the Leeds Festival Rob was approached by a film crew for a TV Interview where he was dubbed “The Rebel of The Leeds Music Scene”. London finally met Rob in October at Lark in the Park, Islington, opening up for 4 UK established acts, On this kind of form it is evident that it will not be his only London Appearance, the same night also saw the launch of his second single “Girls Are Meaner Than Boys”. 2007 promises to be on hell of a year for the Rebel of the Leeds Music Scene..</p>
