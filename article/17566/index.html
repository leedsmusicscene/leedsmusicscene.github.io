    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Tell Where I Lie" recorded by Fossil Collective. The review was written by Jimmy Horrigan in 2013.</p>
    <p>Patience has never been my strong suit but when it comes to waiting for a debut album anticipation forms a pleasant hinterland between the necessary travails of the band and the moment where my hunger is sated. I happily occupy this border territory when, like recently, I'm certain the rewards will outweigh the wait. Having watched Fossil Collective's repertoire swell from self-release through to the official debut, appetite-whetting free downloads and "works in progress" at gigs; I always had high hopes for what Jonny, Dave and the boys would deliver. After one listen to "Tell Where I Lie" it struck me that they had far exceeded my expectations so I'll make no apology to be writing about them again. Plus I wanted to get at least one more piece in before the world catches on and they make headlines and receive acclaim way beyond my customary blether.<br /><br />If you're familiar with earlier releases and as giddy about the album as me you'll be happy to hear that "On and on", "When Frank becomes an orb" and "Let it go" all made the final cut. These songs were instrumental in establishing the band's sound and spirit in the months leading up to the album, the latter winning 6 Music's Rebel Playlist last August and here they sit perfectly alongside new gems like "Monument", "Under my arrest" and "The Magpie". Wherever you wander within "Tell Where I Lie" warm harmonies, deft arrangement and rich production await you. "The Magpie" is the stand-out song for me but that's not to say the album is anything short of perfection it's just that in these seven minutes you're taken on a journey through everything that Jonny and Dave have set out to discover and achieve through their musical rebirth as Fossil Collective and it really, really works.              <br /><br />A relevant, arresting and fresh debut, "Tell Where I Lie" sources stasis from uplifting and contemplative moments alike, never veering from a sound that's entirely their own. Modernity meets heritage head-on throughout without ever sounding forced. Fossil Collective have worked hard to achieve the effortless roll and sway within each song and the flow of the album has a mesmerizing potency that should ensure a rapidly increasing and entirely deserved following. You can catch the guys on their current tour before they head off to the U.S. to support The Boxer Rebellion then return to the U.K. for a busy festival calendar. I saw them play a near-capacity Brudenell last Friday and was blown away. (It's a rare moment when I make a point of giving a standing ovation but their performance of The Magpie left me compelled to rise). The album comprises of ten beautiful songs if you order a physical copy - which I did because I'm a sucker for aesthetics - but if you download via i-Tunes you'll be rewarded with a bonus song for your digital efforts.</p>
