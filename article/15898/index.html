    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for Benson.</p>
    <p>Benson are a brass driven alternative indie band that are excited to be hitting the British music scene. <br /><br />All members have a very wide musical taste which Benson have subtly fused into their own sound, including ex-members of The Dead Pets, Guns on the Roof and N.R.T, they formed in july 2011 and have been hard at work writing original material. <br /><br />They are quickly gaining a reputation for their energetic live shows and catchy tunes.<br /><br />Having already gained a following in the north of England they are looking forward to touring the UK and Europe in 2012 in support of their first full length album.<br /> <br />With one demo under their belt that was played on BBC Introducing and another on its way by the end of the year they are getting very positive reviews.<br /><br />In a time when too many bands perform their music to people and don't necessarily entertain the audience, Benson are just trying to make people enjoy themselves, dance and smile :-).</p>
