    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for The Gastrobots.</p>
    <p>The Gastrobots are a newly formed funk-rock outfit from Leeds consisting of five university music students. The groups original form was made up of only three members - Chris Walker (guitar), Adam Scourfield (drums) and Ricky Whaites (bass) - who came together after bass player Ricky needed a band on the spot to play a party for a friend. Soon the group were regularly jamming and writing original material. Additional members Frankie Tortora (vocals) and Tom Brookes (keys) completed the line-up and making music as a group came easily. Funk quickly emerged as the preferred style, with riff-based songs and definite rock influences. Despite the band only having been together for a few months they already have a large collection of songs and a schedule of gigs starting in May in local student clubs and bars. The Gastrobots are not out to change the face of music, nor do they claim to have written life-changing tunes, they just want to keep it funky....</p>
