    <p>ALT-J today announce their third album, RELAXER, due for release on 9 June via Infectious Music on heavyweight vinyl, CD, cassette and digital formats. The record is the follow up to their number one GRAMMY and BRIT Award-nominated album THIS IS ALL YOURS. <br /><br />The album was recorded all over London - from Shoreditch to St John's Wood; Crouch Hill to Brixton - with producer Charlie Andrew for a third time. A first taste of the LP in the form of its opening track '3WW' is available to stream and download now. <br /><br /><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/309212409&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe><br /><br />ALT-J are JOE NEWMAN, GUS UNGER-HAMILTON and THOM GREEN, one of the most successful British bands of the millennium. RELAXER follows THIS IS ALL YOURS and the Mercury Prize and Ivor Novello Award-winning debut album AN AWESOME WAVE. Between them, the two records have sold in excess of two million copies and their songs have been streamed more than one billion times. <br /><br />The band have headlined festivals across the globe and sold out London O2 Arena and New York's legendary Madison Square Garden on their last tour. <br /><br />They are playing a show at the O2 Arena London and festival appearances over the summer with Blue Dot being the nearest.</p>
