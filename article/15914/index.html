    <p>Mya Tweg- Lead Vocals<br />Jodie Sykes - Guitar/Vocals<br />Laura Bottomley - Bass <br />Carl Butterfield- Guitar<br />Luke Whitley - Drums<br /><br />For Love And Hate are the band to offer post-hardcore fans that pure, unadulterated musical carnage that their lives have been missing. That's not to say they are any other typical post-hardcore band, far from it, but their throat cutting vocals and in-your-face rage will certainly have fans of Alexisonfire, Underoath and Bury Tomorrow left wanting more. Beautifully brutal, For Love And Hate will pound you with huge slabs of hardcore and then send you sky-high with the sort of anthemic melodies most bands could only dream of. Formed in 2005, after a number of line-up changes and rough demos, For Love And Hate found their feet in 2007 and gigged excessively across the north of England. During this time, they shared the stage with some of the biggest acts in the underground scene at the time including Enter Shikari, InMe, Bring Me The Horizon, Walls Of Jericho and You Me At Six. After a year hiatus in 2009, For Love And Hate then released a two song demo and spent months writing and preparing for their return to the music scene. Since then, For Love And Hate have continued to gig in cities across the UK and in October 2011 they headed into the studio with Sean Harrison (The Elijah) to record their debut EP 'In Fear And Faith' which was released on 18th December 2011. The EP showcases the raw talent and song writing quality that sets them apart from their peers. For Love And Hate are a five-piece band who deal in shredding guitars, throat-slicing vocals and solid riffs. Add in some sweet melodies and you can see why the UK underground is in a frenzy over this Yorkshire band..</p>
