    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for The Humour.</p>
    <p>Wakefield-based quartet, The Humour, are causing quite the stir in A&R land at present, both here in the UK and over the pond in the States.<br />Their cleverly-crafted and undeniably infectious brand of feel-good rock belies the fact that they're all just twenty years old. They regularly sell-out The Cockpit in Leeds, a difficult enough task for a well-marketed major-label artist, let alone a young, unsigned band from Wakefield. Their live side has seen them take in shows alongside the likes of The Used, The Wombats, Fightstar, Gallows, Rise Against, Aiden, Kids In Glass Houses and The Blackout.<br /><br />They have had 2 singles out recently, both of which were played across the airwaves and their latest single's video was played on the main playlist of Scuzz TV.<br /><br />In June The Humour have a new album out "You're Gonna Pay" and you can hear previews on their new myspace: http://www.myspace.com/thehumour<br /><br />With a festival appearance at Download booked for June, 2010 looks like it could be a hugely positive year for The Humour..</p>
