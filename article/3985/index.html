    <p>Following a meeting of the licensing committee of Leeds City Council today Mean Fiddler have announced that their application for an increase in the capacity of Leeds Festival 2005 has been successful. The application follows successive sell outs since it moved to its new  home in Bramham Park three years ago, and an additional 2,500 day tickets on Friday, 5,000 tickets on Saturday and 5,000 tickets on Sunday will now go on sale bringing the capacity of the event to over 60,000.<br /><br />Melvin Benn (Mean Fiddler) said of the decision:<br /><br />"We are delighted that more music fans over the country can enjoy the Carling Weekend: Reading and Leeds Festivals and that both Leeds and Reading Councils have continued to support the live music events in the North and South of the country. It is fantastic news for the fans and now an additional 12,500 people in Leeds and the North of England and 11,000 people in Reading and the South of England get to see their favourite bands at the UK's biggest selling  festival"<br /><br />The Carling Weekend: Leeds Festival runs from Friday 26th August to Sunday 28th August with headliners Pixies, Foo Fighters and Iron Maiden joined by more than 150 bands for what is sure to be the event of the summer.<br /><br />For the latest line up and ticket news visit Leeds Festival</p>
