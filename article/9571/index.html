        <h1>Shakinouts - Time You Were Told</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Time You Were Told" recorded by Shakinouts. The review was written by Dave Sugden in 2008.</p>
    <p>The debut single from Leeds four-piece Shakinouts is a bouncy indie pop number that sits very squarely within its genre.  Although 'Time You Were Told' doesn't push any boundaries, it would be argued that it's not actually trying to. It delivers competent playing throughout, good-enough vocals, and a fairly catchy chorus to sing along to, which make up for the rather non-descript verse.<br><br>Then it's onto B-side 'Ten Steps Ahead'. Once we're past the Pigeons-esque guitar line intro, we drop into a vocal delivery style straight out of the early 90s, a la Carter USM or Wedding Present. It's a touch quirkier, and less 'pop' focussed and the vocal has a little <i>something</i> for the listener to hold onto.<br><br>Although there is little to shout from the rooftops about just yet, there is still a glimmer of songwriting potential shining through that could be worked on to bring Shakinouts out of the shadows of current fare like Libertines and The Pigeon Detectives.<br><br>So it's decision time. While Shakinouts appear to be trying to head down Main Street - which, to be honest, is fairly well-trodden these days so you need to be extra special to stand out and force your way through - there are still a couple of side streets the band could venture down if they were feeling particularly adventurous.</p>
