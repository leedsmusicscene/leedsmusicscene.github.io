    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for Guns on the Roof.</p>
    <p>Guns on the Roof come from the wrong side of Leeds, Crossgates and Halton Moor, areas that spawned the likes of 80's punk bands Abrasive Wheels, Icon AD, Urban Zones and more recently Dead Pets. Their songs are full of emotion and hope. With an average age of only seventeen, they have all the energy and venom of the above bands but combine it with a modern day sound that far surpasses their lowly years.<br><br>After only several gigs they were spotted by Dave Ryan founder member of Abrasive Wheels who imediately signed them to his record label and management company. In a bid to capture the atmosphere of the 80's Dave took them along to his old house in Crossgates where he and Shonna wrote and rehearsed the 'When The Punks Go Marching In' album. Armed with pen, paper and two old guitars, the band set to work on their debut single. The outcome was 'Demized', an anthem with the power and ferocity of any 80's UK band. All the influenses are there, Exploited, GBH, Wheels, Clash, Ramones, but they have a modern day edge with overtones of Rancid, The Distillers and Greenday..</p>
