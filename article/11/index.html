        <h1>Amberman - Untitled</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Untitled" recorded by Amberman. The review was written by Dave Sugden in 2001.</p>
    <p>Amberman's five-track CD comes in a very well presented package with an equally well-designed CD cover; on the inside there is the message: "this is the eagerly anticipated first demo".  Unfortunately, the design covers for some well-played but not very capturing music.<br><bR>The general feel throughout the CD is melancholy.  Even when Amberman are trying to play an upbeat vintage indie song  - for example, "Sundown" and "Deadwood", which are guitar music circa The Smiths or Wedding Present era - they still get dragged down through Alex's vocals into telling a story of gloom.  Perhaps this is intentional, perhaps not.  It's certainly not a bad thing to want to do, so long as it's pulled off.<Br><Br>Opening up the CD is the arpeggio-driven "Can't Speak (let alone sing your name)" with its downtrodden vocals and a story of misery - "I've been rehearsing all day, All these words I've got to say, But I've just drunk my mind away".  However, in the end, it did little for me.<Br><bR>What Amberman are trying to do is all well and good, and it's about time a local band tried to write something that got people into feeling their music again - rather than just bouncing happy upbeat tunes off them.  On the other hand it's a hard genre to do very well. I mean, if you're going to listen to a band doing gut-wrenching stuff then they've got be perfect (e.g. "Everybody Hurts").  Either that, or you tend not to want to listen at all - it's a fine line that Amberman look to be on the wrong side of at the moment.  Give it time.</p>
