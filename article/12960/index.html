    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for Canaya.</p>
    <p>Formed in 2010, featuring ex-members of Tangaroa, Executive Distraction Tasks, Hot Prophecy and Nerve Engine. Canaya's sound draws from an uncompromising urge to play powerful heavy music, pulling metal firmly into the 21st Century. <br /><br />The debut EP, 'Alignment Of Dying Planets' was released in 2010 to great reviews in Rocksound (8/10), Big Cheese (5/5) and received heavy rotation on Total Rock Radio.<br /><br />'What the industry has it's sights on' - Metal Hammer<br /><br />'Alignment Of Dying Planets' is twenty minutes of unremitting ferocity. It's an aggressively potent EP, the kind of record that will have you smashing yourself across the temple with a hammer afterwards for relief.' - Szikora Press<br /><br />'Canaya have made soul destroying brutality their business. Their EP has received a wealth of praise from the rock press and the blogosphere beyond, they are unquestionably a band on the rise.' - Big Spaceship<br /><br />'Combining a voice with the caustic power of Norma Jean with some seriously Mastodon-esque riffs, Canaya's EP is a violent twenty-minute pole-axe to the temple.' - Heavy Blog Is Heavy<br /><br />'It certainly has that 'ugly' sort of flair to it and is a brutal as a herd of rhinos on the charge.' - Metal Team UK<br /><br />'Canaya are like a breath of fresh air!' - Ginger, The Wildhearts<br /><br />Gigs have followed at Damnation Festival, Brew Records, Big Spaceship, Brainwash, British Wildlife amongst many others. <br /><br />Shared the stage with the likes of Narrows, Keelhaul, Knut, Coliseum, Humanfly, Melt Banana, Hawk Eyes, Brontide and Lavotchkin.<br /><br />The video for the single, 'Dios Muerto', became a YouTube favourite and caught the attention of Ginger from The Wildhearts, who asked Simon to record guest vocals on his 'Mutation' album.<br /><br />With a host of new material, Canaya have released their sophomore EP 'Sealed Within The Walls'.<br /><br />Canaya are:<br />Simon Wright - Vocals<br />Owen Wilson - Guitars/Vocals<br />Chris Wilson - Bass/Vocals<br />Andy Richards - Drums<br /><br />Influences:<br />Metallica, Pantera, Anthrax, Sepultura, Entombed, Crowbar, Unsane, Mastodon.</p>
