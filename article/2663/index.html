        <h1>Project New City - Untitled</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Untitled" recorded by Project New City. The review was written by Gavin Miller in 2004.</p>
    <p>House music is an odd genre. Over the past few years, it’s been everywhere from funk to punk, and back again. Anyone who ever ventures into a music store or reads a dance music-orientated mag knows about just how many sub-groups of house there are now. Although what ‘tribal house’ is supposed to be, I have no idea.<br><br>‘Full Circle’, the first track here starts as if it’s some kind of acoustic ditty, complete with strummy guitars and weird guitar leads. Then, it transforms into a funky, catchy little house number, with its sweeping pads, its bouncy 4/4 beats and its soaring vocals. Now I’m not the biggest fan of dance music, but I know what I like, and in this case, I like. Although you can well imagine a dancefloor full of people “gangster trippin’” (to quote Phoenix Nights), to this song, it still retains this kind of hazy melancholia. Maybe it’s the minor chords, but I love dance music that feels sort of depressed.<br><br>It has to be said, the production values on this CD are absolutely spot on. Mainstream producers up and down the country should take a listen and hear how some intelligent dance music should be made. ‘I’m So Angry’ has all the ingredients of another great house track, with its driving, funky rhythms and dreamy synth breaks, it’s again the sort of dance music I can agree with. Having already studied music production, I think these guys are top notch at what they do. I’m sure it won’t be long until the major labels come a knocking.<br><br>I know what you’re thinking. All dance music is the same, but sometimes, something like this manages to sneak in the back door and completely take you by surprise. It’s the sound of French dance music circa 1999, but better. And in English.</p>
