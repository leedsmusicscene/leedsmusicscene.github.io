        <h1>Fifth Goodbye - In Amber EP</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "In Amber EP" recorded by Fifth Goodbye. The review was written by Tony Pasquariello in 2002.</p>
    <p>Fifth Goodbye are a 4-piece metal band from Leeds.  At least that's what it says on the box.  At first I thought to myself, "another metal band churning out the same old rubbish" but I was mistaken.  Bringing together a mixture of styles from emo to hardcore metal, they create a sound that is a joy to listen to. The song <I>In Amber</I> is a classic in the making.  A very powerful track in its style, the guitars are full on and intense, the vocals superb, and I guess this would be a great track live.  The 3 tracks on this EP are all musically different, and they all work well together.  Their vocalist has a very gravely voice, and really suits the music well.  The guitars on all the tracks are superb, but the only thing that lets this band down is the timing.  Other than that, look out for Fifth Goodbye.  Go see them and be caught up in their music.</p>
