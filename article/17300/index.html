        <h1>Harry George Johns - Post Breakdown Blues</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Post Breakdown Blues" recorded by Harry George Johns. The review was written by Glen Pinder in 2013.</p>
    <p>This mini album/EP from Harry George Johns rises from the ashes of break-ups and breakdowns, the sound of late nights and early mornings resonates throughout these six songs.<br /><br />Album opener "Drink myself to sleep" is testament to this, part howl at the moon and part lament to lost love and foolish hearts.<br /><br />As it is with "All you can do" the theme remains, with a slight nod to Ryan Adams, Love is Hell era melancholy, only with an image of sitting watching the sun rise over Leeds with a bottle of Whiskey, sad euphoria, reflective yet hopeful of the distant horizon.<br /><br />"Tie your own noose" is a brilliantly catchy Country jump shuffle, all bottle neck guitar and handclaps propelling things forward, plus a vocal that ranges from soft and lilting to a growl and a holler. Yet sadness hides behind the bluster, the "I'm so alone" refrain could sound contrived in lesser voices, but is carried home by the song-writing and delivery of Harry George Johns.<br /><br />And it's the song-writing here that really shines through, searching for the reflection and redemption that only music can bring, each song thoughtfully constructed and executed.<br /><br />As shown on "Morning Song" and "Hospital Blues", where finding yourself at the bottom of a bottle and climbing your way out to find, maybe all is not lost.<br /><br />This is a damn fine collection of songs and shows a talent really growing into himself, amid torrid times the life raft to hold on to is the hopeful redemption of love, friendship and music.<br /><br />And in these six songs we might just be a little closer to finding it..<br /><br />Fans can find the album at Harry George Johns bandcamp page.<br /><br />Release date: February 17th 2013.</p>
