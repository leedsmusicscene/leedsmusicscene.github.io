    <p>Oblong Resource Centre is holding an all day music event at The Primrose Pub on Meanwood Road on Saturday 17th May to raise funds for the Forget-Me-Not Trust.<BR><br>This unique charity focuses on relieving the awful stress of terminal illness in the young by giving them a chance to enjoy themselves. As Edwina Warrington, founder trustee with the Morley based charity says: "all money raised for The Forget-Me-Not Trust goes to the children. The sole purpose is to provide sick children with treats and morale boosters."<BR><br>With some of the cream of local talent on display, it is anticipated to bring in a packed audience, with the following bands all 
confirmed to give their support to the event:<BR><br>Babaganoush, 10,000 Things, Codex, The Soundwaves, Deepwater, Invention of Hands and Randomiser with more acts still to be confirmed.<BR><br>A number of acoustic performers will be playing on the day and who regularly perform at the popular weekly open-mic sessions at The Primrose.<BR><br>Mike Jolly from Oblong said: "it's fantastic that so many bands have been so enthusiastic about playing at this event and providing their services for free; I'm sure it will be a great day." Oblong supports local not-for-profit projects by providing office services, training and advice.<BR><br>The all-day event takes place at The Primrose Pub, Meanwood Road, Leeds 7 (tel: 262-1368) and entry is £3.00 on the day. Doors open at 1.00pm and it finishes at midnight.</p>
