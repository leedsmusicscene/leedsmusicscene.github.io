    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2012.</p>
    <p>Melvin Benn, the Managing Director at Leeds Festival organisers Festival Republic, has this week said to the NME, here, that he plans to put in place a ticket deposit scheme in time for the official Leeds 2012 tickets sale.<br /><br />In the interview he announced that there is "going to be a deposit sale introduced for the March main sale". And in reference to last year's late decision to run a pay-by-installment scheme, Melvin added that 2012 "will be the first time we've done that properly."<br /><br />Melvin also confirmed that ticket prices would not be dropped in 2012: "It would be lovely to make them cheaper if it was economically viable but it isn't. The sad thing is that the cost of running a festival, from infrastructure to sound, lights and bands, has increased and it's just not viable to reduce the prices. I wish it was. If it was, believe me, I would do it."<br /><br />Last year's tickets cost £192.50 each, and historically ticket prices have increased by between £5 and £20 each year. <br /><br />Leeds Music Scene expect the price for 2012 tickets to remain under £200.<br /><br />Yorkshire music fans should remember that tickets are currently not on sale and anywhere selling tickets now may not be doing so legitimately. You should only buy your ticket from ticket agencies authorised by Festival Republic.<br /><br />Tickets will go on official sale in March (probably the 19th or 26th), available via Ticketmaster, See Tickets and Viagogo or through our Leeds 2012 tickets page.</p>
