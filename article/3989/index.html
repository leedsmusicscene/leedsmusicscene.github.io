        <h1>The Nervous Shakedown - Untitled</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Untitled" recorded by The Nervous Shakedown. The review was written by Simon Glacken in 2005.</p>
    <p>Well known for their sleazy stoner rock The Nervous Shakedown have been spreading their own brand of guitar filth across West Yorkshire. The last EP was a dark affair with repetitive hypnotic riffs and gloomy mesmerising tunes, which veered towards the likes of the Queens of the Stone Age and other bands within the stoner rock movement.<Br><br>This EP however is more of a wake up call from that drowsy feeling. “Come with me” is an absolute rock beast, which packs an enormous punch that, is fierce, heavy and unrelenting. While the vocals have gone from the cool and calmness of a British Josh Homme to a fierce growl which would even scare Kyuss’s John Garcia. This sees The Nervous Shakedown finding their own sound and it fits them like a black, studded, leather glove.<Br><br>As with all Shakedown CDs after every listen you have an unquenchable thirst to pop down to your local bikers club, tap the biggest meathead you can find and then crack a bar stool over his head, and the same feelings rise up with this EP as well. “Not Playing God” is an awkward relaxing ditty while final track “White Shoe Rock N’ Roll” continues the trend of top notch tunes which are attached to a battery pack of energy and excitement.<Br><br>Sleazy, dirty and probably wrong but it damn well feels good.</p>
