    <p>King of the Mountains is a three-day music and arts festival taking place in the idyllic village of Muker, Swaledale this July. Created to highlight the stunning beauty of the area during the historic Yorkshire Grand Depart and to celebrate the best in live performance, culture and food from Yorkshire and beyond. On the 5th July, Le Tour de France passes through Swaledale and right by the festival. <br /><br />The first acts booked to play include award winning DJ, Huw Stephens (DJ) who presents on BBC Radio 1 as well as maintaining a busy diary compering and curating his own festivals. Huw will bring the Saturday to a close.  <br /><br />Closing the Sunday night is Paul Thomas Saunders, having just released his first album to huge critical acclaim, called 'sensational' by The Guardian and billed as 'one of the finest debut records in quite some time' from The 405. With comparisons to Jeff Buckley and early Radiohead, and a reputation for providing spellbinding performances without fail, Paul will ensure a special Sunday evening. <br /><br />Other truly great additions include Sky Larkin, Three Blind Wolves, Pip Mountjoy, To Kill a King, Kyla La Grange, Hey Sholay, Blue Rose Code,  Young Rebel Set, Eaves, Goodbye Chanel, The Witch Hunt, Sam Airey,  Jasmine Kennedy, Yarbo, Crybabycry, Charlie Straw and Jacobean Ruff.<br /><br />With music, comedy, Yorkshire food and ale, kids and family activities plus Tour De Cinema, camping cycle and car parks as well as huge screens to watch all the action, King Of the Mountains is one of the best places to enjoy the Tour De France weekend. <br /><br />King  of  the  Mountains  festival  tickets  are  on  sale  now,  priced  at  £39   for  an  adult weekend  ticket.  Young  people  (aged  12-17)  are  priced  at  £25,  while children  (aged 6-11) are  £15, and  under 6 go free.<br /><br />Camping, Parking, Group and Family tickets are also available.
