    </div>
    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2004.</p>
    <p>For the new season of gigs at the Royal Park Cellars the venue will be unveiling a gallery of work by their official in-house photographer Kevin Petch. The exhibition will launch the full in-house photography service that the venue is offering in conjunction with Thoroughbred newMedia.<br><br>The initial exhibition - selected from hundreds of photos taken by Kevin at gigs - will be in the access area of the venue and will consist of just 20 shots. Both local and touring bands have been covered and it is the venue's intention to rotate the exhibition on a regular basis. The exhibition may also be extended into the venue itself and the ground floor of the Royal Park if there is sufficient interest.<Br><Br>In addition a much larger on-line gallery will be launched in the next few weeks which will contain web quality versions of many more photos taken by Kevin at the venue which will be added to on a regular basis.<Br><bR>Venue promoter Steve Kind said:<bR><br>"We're very lucky to have found a photographer who is as in to the music as we are and who can capture the unique atmosphere of the Royal Park Cellars - Kevin has worked really hard to put this initial exhibition together and he's going to continue to attend a wide range of shows over the coming months"<br><br>Low resolution images will be available to bands for website use free of charge (subject to copyright and credit). High resolution 10x8 prints (framed or unframed) and original source files will be available for a 
competitive fee.</p>
