        <h1>¡Forward, Russia! confirmed for Live At Leeds 2014</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2014.</p>
    <p>In association with local independent record label Dance to The Radio, Leeds Town Hall has been confirmed as a new venue for Live At Leeds 2014. <br /><br />And if watching a gig in one of Leeds' most prestigious buildings wasn't exciting enough for Leeds music fans, the organisers of the annual multi-venue festival have confirmed that ¡Forward, Russia! will be headlining the night on Saturday 3rd May.<br /><br />Guitarist Whiskas said, "After playing the 100 year anniversary at the Brudenell last year there was really no intention to do anything else. We never played Live At Leeds the first time around, but the opportunity to headline such a great venue with great friends was too good to turn down."<br /><br />Joining them at Leeds Town Hall will be I Like Trains, who recently celebrated ten years as a band and whose history has been inextricably linked with ¡Forward, Russia!.<br /><br />"Tom and Whiskas were working at our very first show, Whiskas put out our first single on Dance to the Radio and we've remained good friends and collaborators ever since.  It is great to see them doing their spiky thing once again.", said Dave Martin.<br /><br />Also confirmed for the new stage are Newcastle's Lanterns On The Lake and Sam Airey, who will be bringing his full band show to the Town Hall and with it songs from his acclaimed 'A Marker & A Map EP'.<br /><br />"Truth be told, I'm excited! I'm fairly certain it'll be the biggest Leeds show we've played as a full band, and pretty wonderful to be sharing the stage with bands who are not only are musicians I admire but also mates of mine", said Sam.<br /><br />The bands extend an already impressive Live At Leeds 2014 line up that was announced earlier this year [read full line up].<br /><br />Tickets for the Saturday all-dayer can be purchased for just £25 via Leeds Gig Tickets. Tickets are exchanged for wristbands on the day of Live At Leeds 2014.</p>
