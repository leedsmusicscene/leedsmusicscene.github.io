    <p>Matt MIller - Lead Guitar, Lead vocals<br>Sam Fenner - Guitar, vocals<br>Will Merril - Drums, vocals<br><br>The origins of Warning?!-Achtung?! all came from a 15-year-old guitarist, Sam Fenner, hungry for the opportunity to play in a successful band. After the shambolic attempt of his old band PLEX Sam went looking for talent.<br><br>Old school friend Will Merril decided PLEX wasn't the place to remain as a drummer and went on a journey with Sam to find a frontman. Being reluctant to join a band 17-year-old Matt Miller, a talented guitarist knew Sam from a local Horsforth Music Centre and met Will through one of his Birthday Parties. The idea of a 3 piece, no bass band was only a mere idea talked about for lesss than a minute, yet it soon became reality as Sam's persuasion dragged Matt into joining the band not knowing he, himself would not only be lead singer, but lead guitarist.<br><br>After one practice there was chemistry. 4 Hours practice, 3 songs a few broken cookies and the foundations of a band were created,that band now being... Warning?!-Achtung?!.</p>
