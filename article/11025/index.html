    <p>Hannah Trigwell's second EP 'Not Enough', due to be released on August 8th, is the product of an exciting, whirlwind year for the 20-year-old singer-songwriter from Leeds. With four brand new tracks, 'Not Enough' showcases Hannah's distinctive acoustic-pop sound and songwriting, but also indicates a natural growth in her abilities as both a musician and lyricist. <br /><br />'Headrush', the lead single from 'Not Enough', was released in late spring to a great response from fans as well as the media. Off the back of its success, Hannah was nominated for, and won, the Best International Unsigned Act at the 2011 St. Helier Cider Online Music Awards. <br /><br />In just three years Hannah Trigwell has gone from unknown 17-year-old busker to exciting, emerging 20-year-old recording artist. Digital and hard copies of her music sell all around the world and her YouTube profile has had more than 2,500,000 views and gains over 10,000 hits a day. With fans in North America, Australia, and Asia, as well as across Europe and here in the UK, Hannah Trigwell is on her way to becoming a global musician..</p>
