        <h1>The Pigeon Detectives - Everybody Wants Me</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Everybody Wants Me" recorded by The Pigeon Detectives. The review was written by John Hepworth in 2008.</p>
    <p>It’s a shortish journey from Leeds to Sheffield and you haven’t strayed far if your route  includes Rothwell – a place much closer to Leeds as people might say who think they hear some Kaiser Chiefs in The Pigeon Detectives. The Leeds connection can seem very close indeed for the Brudenell coterie. So I wish there was more to report: what you hear if you buy this second single taken from the current album depends on which version you have: either way, there’s a new song as well as the one publicising Emergency. The reviewer peevishly slapping these words into the keyboard has received the issue with just one track, the one DJs will be playing on radio stations - for which ‘Everybody Wants Me’ is ideal material, a sharp production and a good bouncy song.</p>
