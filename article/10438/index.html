    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2009.</p>
    <p>Fuse Leeds 09 organisers have announced the first shows for this year’s programme, which encourage established and new talents across musical genres, as well as the visual arts and even architecture, to embark on new creative ventures.<br><br>The event bursts into action with Fusillage, a new commission which celebrates the UK’s bell ringing tradition and brings it bang up to date with new bell peals written by leading composer Gavin Bryars and French multi-instrumentalist Colleen (25 April, Leeds Parish Church).<br><br>One of Leeds’ most treasured artists and responsible for eighteen UK Top 40 hits with his band The Wedding Present, David Gedge joins forces with the BBC Big Band in a specially commissioned arrangement which puts a contemporary twist on his best loved tracks from the last 20 years, conducted by Steve Sidwell (29 April, West Yorkshire Playhouse).<br><br>Fuse Leeds 09 presents the UK premiere of Efterklang's score to their celebrated 2007 album Parades (The Leaf Label) for band and orchestra. The band will perform their majestic, otherworldly pop songs alongside acclaimed orchestra Britten Sinfonia at Leeds Academy on April 25.<br><br>Taking inspiration from the creative approach of influential architect and composer, Iannis Xenakis, Fuse Leeds 09 has commissioned three new graphical scores by practitioners who explore the boundaries of visual art, architecture and composition.  Manchester based chamber ensemble Psappha, conducted by Nicholas Kok, will perform works by graphic designer and sound toy developer, Paul Farrington (Studio Tonne), architects Amenity Space and composer Leafcutter John.  This event will also include a screening of the BBC’s documentary, Something Rich and Strange: The Life and Music of Iannis Xenakis (2 May, Assembly Rooms, Opera North).<br><br>The full Fuse Leeds 09 programme, featuring over 30 events, will be announced on 27th February at a launch event preceding the world premiere of Matthew Bourne’s Songs From A Lost Piano, which brings Yorkshire’s discarded keyboard gems back to life for three haunting UK performances and an evocative photographic exhibition (The Venue, Leeds College of Music).</p>
