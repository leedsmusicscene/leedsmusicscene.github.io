        <h1>Waking the Witch set to record a live DVD at their new album's Leeds launch party</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2007.</p>
    <p>Local girls Waking the Witch release a new CD - 'Boys from the Abattoir' - on 5th February and have announced a 40-day nationwide tour to coincide with the album. The Leeds launch event will take place on 25th January at Leeds City Varieties and the date will see the filming and production of a live DVD – all audience members will get a personal mention on the DVD itself.<br><br>The album was produced by Dave Creffield (Embrace, Kaiser Chiefs), and the result of this collaboration is an album that brings an edgier, more urban Waking the Witch than has been heard previously. Still very much in evidence are the four girls’ trademark acoustic guitars and lush vocal harmonies but this time round, all the songs are backed by a powerful rhythm section, and, on the Gothic anthem, ‘Me Leaving Me’, the distinctive, stirring electric guitar of Bruce Watson (Big Country).<br><br>In other news, the band have followed 2005 winner Kate Rusby by winning the Classic Rock Society’s Acoustic/Roots Performer of the Year 2006 award and the year has seen the band play unplugged on numerous radio shows, including sessions for Radio 2’s Janice Long and BBC Radio London’s Charlie Gillett.
