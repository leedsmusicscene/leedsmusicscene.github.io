    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for Mama Scuba.</p>
    <p>Mama Scuba formed in Leeds in the late 90s, and after winning fans locally with their explosive live performances they set about recording. Following their debut CDs - "She's Good" (1997) and the "Clocked It EP" (1998),  which ultimately led to Melody Maker proclaiming the band to be their "Top Tip Of 1999" - the band released a couple of singles on their Siamese Chins label.<br><br>Having previously worked with Choque Hosein of Black Star Liner (Mercury Music Prize nominee) and Will Seargent (Echo & The Bunnymen), Mama Scuba released the single "Snow" in April 2000. The song was picked up by Steve Lamacq on Radio 1 for his unsigned 'session of the week' and with more airplay went on to reach #24 in the UK indie chart.<bR><br>Music365 also voted the single their "Single of the Week".<br><bR>The follow up "Pouche" was to follow and also picked up airplay in the UK and Europe and reached #21 in the indie charts.<br><br>After the success of their releases the band continued to hone their craft with live performances around the UK, including an appearance at Leeds Carling Festival before setting about recording their debut album with Leeds-based producer Carl Rosamond.<br><br>With the band drawing comparisons with Pavement, Pixies and more recently Franz Ferdinand the album helps define art-rock.<br><br>"You're a long time dead, so what's the hurry?" will be released in February 2005 on Redemption Records and Mama Scuba have at last been able to get down on record their powerful music. In doing so they provide a strong and cohesive entree into their unique oeuvre..</p>
