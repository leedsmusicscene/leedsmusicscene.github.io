    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2011.</p>
    <p>Middleman have announced the release of their debut album 'Spinning Plates' on May 1st through Blip Records / Universal.<br /><br />The album will be preceded by a new single, the title track and album opener, on March 27th. <br /><br />The band self-produced the album in Leeds and it reflects a time in which they found themselves completely overwhelmed trying to juggle day jobs, fighting bad management and trying to keep control of their own music. <br /><br />The album also features the singles 'It's Not Over Yet' and 'Chipping Away', which have both received support from BBC Radio 1, XFM, Kerrang! Radio, BBC Introducing, Sub TV and NME Radar TV.<br /><br />'It's Not Over Yet' has also opened up some interesting opportunities since being synced to the NBA 2K11 computer game alongside Snoop Dogg and Two Door Cinema Club. The album track 'Clipped Wings' has been synced to the trailer for the new series of The Gadget Show on Channel 5 and other syncs include E4 Music and SKY TV.<br /><br />You can watch the video to the new single below:<br /><br /></p>
