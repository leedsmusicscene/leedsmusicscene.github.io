    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for Tiger Shadow.</p>
    <p>Tiger Shadow are alternative hip-hop pioneers from Leeds, blending intelligent and socially conscious rhymes with multi-layered compositions and urban grooves to create something you've never quite heard before. Beautiful string arrangements play alongside swirling synths and bone crunching riffs, underpinned by heavy-duty drum programming to quench a musical thirst you never knew you had.<br /><br />Tiger Shadow was created after Jim & Komla entered their first collaborations into a Sandman magazine competition, which resulted in the band's first ever gigs being played at the Leeds & Reading Festivals on the BBC Introducing stage in 2008. They have also played the Big Chill Festival, Leeds Unity Day, a live set for BBC Raw Talent, and were in the final 12 out of 1600 acts for the Emerging Talent Competition to play Glastonbury in 2010.<br /><br />The band has almost completed their second studio album 'The Adventures Of The Tiger Shadow' which is currently being mastered in New York by The Engine Room, and continues their collaboration with producer Matt Peel who has worked with Leeds luminaries such as The Kaiser Chiefs and The Pigeon Detectives. It's a departure from the styles of their previous recordings and sees a return to the roots of the band with Komla providing the drum beats, lyrics and vocals, while Jim provides the music, accompanied by special guests here and there.<br /><br />The first album and 2 EPs are available in their entirety to listen to for free at www.tigershadow.com or on iTunes if you prefer your own copy to do with as you please.<br /><br /><br />Leeds Music Scene: "Tiger Shadow are bringing together a range of styles and influences to make something new and distinctive. Funk, Reggae, Trip Hop, Indie and World Music float in and out. It's definitely new sounding, and with Komla's presence it's distinctive and recognisable."<br /><br />Tom Robinson - BBC Radio 6: "a shake of the musical kaleidoscope that you haven't heard before. Great rap vocals and beats over a hot British guitar band".</p>
