    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for The Dauntless Elite.</p>
    <p>The Dauntless Elite formed in late 2003 in Leeds, Uk from previous bands: Joe Ninety (Lee Wall - Vocals&Guitar, Andrew Jackson - Bass) & FIG.4.0 (Joe Alderdice - Vocals&Guitar, Stephen Hastwell - Drums). They play Punk Rock in the vein of American Steel, Snuff & Leatherface. In fact they'd say they probably rip those bands off a little too much.<br /> <br />The band released a 6 track EP on the amazing Plan-It-X Records (home to bands like Ghost Mice, One Reason & Japanther!) called Security? EP which you can also get on 10" vinyl from Somebody's Song Records. Also available is the collaborative split 7" they recorded with their friends in Jets vs Sharks and a split 7" with a great Japanese band called The Because which was released on Japan's Snuffy Smile Records.<br /> <br />The Dauntless Elite have a couple of new releases that have been out in few months: a split 7" with The Mercury League from Sunderland on Yo Yo Records of Germany and their first full length album, titled Graft. The CD release is a split with Plan It X records (US) and Bombed Out while the gatefold vinyl release will be a split between same Bombed Out and the band's own Cool Tool Records label..</p>
