        <h1>Blacklisters unveil debut album BLKLSTRS</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2012.</p>
    <p>Released 24/04/2012 on LP, CD & Digital Download. Pre-order from 02/04/2012.<br /><br />Brew's notorious ear for the heavy has been pricked by a band making a significant impact on the UK underground rock scene: Blacklisters. The band's full length debut, BLKLSTRS, is their heaviest, most visceral collection of songs to date, and finds a perfect home at Brew, amongst releases by Holy State, Hawk Eyes, Castrovalva, Kong & Humanfly.<br /><br />From the outset, BLKLSTRS is an unrelenting noise rock tour de force. Billy Mason-Wood's skewed and often terrifying vocals with Dante Beesley's sharp, distinctive guitar command your undivided attention. Whilst underneath, Owen Griffiths' marauding bass lines and Alistair Stobbart's unrelenting drumming drive the songs with genuine menace. Taking cues from Leeds favorites Pulled Apart By Horses and label mates Kong, Blacklisters have drawn comparisons to 400 Blows, Shellac and early Glassjaw. With Dan Carter (BBC Radio1 Rock Show) likening them to noise rock giants The Jesus Lizard, Blacklisters first ferocious and uncompromising full length pulls no punches.<br /><br />Formed in 2008, Blacklisters quickly earned a reputation as a formidable live act through aggressive, confrontational performances riddled with dark humor. In 2009, the Swords 7" was released to critical acclaim, while 2010 saw the release of the Belt Party EP. The latter gained the band further positive coverage in the national press, including Artrocker Magazine's single of the week.<br /><br />Their live presence continued to grow in 2011 through supporting Melt Banana, Rolo Tomassi and Hawk Eyes amongst others, and touring with fellow northern rebels Pulled Apart by Horses and Kong, as well as London friends Japanese Voyeurs. Successful festival appearances at Leeds and Reading 2010 resulted in being asked back to open Leeds Festival in 2011.<br /><br />Blacklisters followed their busy summer by entering the studio to record their debut album. Produced by Ross Halden at Ghost Town and mastered by Carl Saff (Young Widows, Oxes, Melt Banana), this release showcases song writing and playing only hinted at on the band's previous releases, and announces the band's potential as a major force in underground rock music.<br /><br />Track listing:<br /><br />01 Clubfoot by Kasabian 2m59<br />02 Swords 3m31<br />03 Nice Garden 4m28 <br />04 OK47 3m42<br />05 I Can Confirm That Ruth Abigail Holmes Is Not Dead and Is Planning To Make a Movie About Her Life 4m05<br />06 Mouthpeace 3m37<br />07 Ask Yourself a Question If The Answer Is Go F*ck Yourself 4.52<br />08 Hero of China 2m32<br />09 Trickfuck 2m56<br />10 Shush 5m15<br /><br />March Tour dates:<br /><br />Monday 12th - The Garage, London w/Scratch Acid<br /><br />With Shapes:<br /><br />Friday 16th - Birmingham, The Rainbow<br />Saturday 17th - London, The Wilmington<br />Wednesday 21st - Glasgow, Bloc - Free entry<br />Thursday 22nd - York, Stereo<br />Friday 23rd - Hartlepool, Studio<br />Saturday 24th - Leeds, The Library<br /><br />May:<br /><br />Saturday 5th May Live at Leeds<br />Sunday 6th May Camden Crawl<br /><br />On Blacklisters:<br /><br />"A wonderful wake-up call." - Drowned in Sound<br /><br />"The filthy, quivering grooves sound face-cavingly immense - Kerrang!</p>
