    <p>As if a great festival with loads of great bands wasn't enough, this year Live At Leeds organisers are offering an opportunity for people interested in working in the music industry to come together and share ideas via the "Live at Leeds - The Unconference" event.<br /><br />The Unconference has been put together in partnership between Futuresound and Leeds Metropolitan University. It is a music industry conference with a difference, where alongside practical advice on entering the industry side of the music world, those with experience will help guide you on your own path to musical fulfilment.<br /><br />A range of discussion seminars and workshops, led by those with experience on a local and national level, will help you to understand your aims and dreams, and discover what opportunities are available to you and how to make the most of them. <br /><br />Contributors include Drowned in Sound, Sony Music, NME, Wichita, Dance To The Radio and Futuresound.<br /><br />The Unconference takes place on Friday 30th April between 10am and 8pm at the Old Broadcasting House on Woodhouse Lane. The day will finish with live performances from Sam Airey and Tall Like Giants. The conference is free and open to all.<br /><br />For more information, including how to how to register and copy of the programme visit www.liveatleeds.com/other_events.html.</p>
