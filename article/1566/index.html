    <p>Panama Promotions have announced their preliminary listings for the Autumn Season at the Royal Park Cellars venue in Leeds - and along with it, a new policy of aiming to have at least one band at every show from outside Leeds. With 45 gigs currently listed between October 10th and December 20th there are 50 bands that are not based in Leeds.<bR><bR>Steve Kind of Panama Promotions explains:<bR>"As RPC has become better known we've had more and more out-of-town bands contacting us for gigs and we've always tried to accommodate them.  With the increased number of gigs we're putting on we decided it was time to take it one step further and make it a policy to encourage bands new to Leeds - and bring back the best bands that have visited the City before."<bR><bR>"Out of Town" could mean Huddersfield or Bradford - but it could also mean Europe, the USA or Canada - acts from all these places will feature in the forthcoming season - some highlights of which will be The Pharmacy Prophets from Washington DC, The High Dials from Montreal, Cayto from Glasgow, DRAT from Belfast, Felix Kubin from Germany (in association with DIY promoter Andy Brown) and many others.<Br><br>Listings for the Royal Park Cellars are updated regularly at: www.royalparkcellars.co.uk.</p>
