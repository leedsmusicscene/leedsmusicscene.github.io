    <p>RECON Festival 2014 takes place at multiple venues across Leeds and Bradford between 18th-29th September. <br /><br />The festival is a selection of experimental and innovative music events, covering a mixture of musical genres, along with film and art. <br /><br />This year highlights include Stephen O'Malley at Brudenell Social Club; Blixa Bargeld at Howard Assembly Rooms; James Yorkston and David Thomas Broughton at Howard Assembly Rooms; Slum Village at Belgrave Music Hall; 20,000 Days on earth  - The Nick Cave film showing at Hyde Park Picture House; Juxtavoices and Scratch Orchestra at Delius Arts and Cultural Centre, Bradford.<br /><br />Also featured this year will be an exhibition and screening of films by celebrated Indian documentary filmmaker Anand Patwardhan at the University of Bradford's Gallery II, and a collaboration between noise-rockers That Fucking Tank and artist Yvonne Carmichael for an event that promises to exist at the crossroads of a Silent Disco, underground gig, sound installation and movement-based participative performance. <br /><br />"This year's festival is shaping up to be even more packed than last years" says Andy Abbott, one of the directors and Fellow in Music at University of Bradford. "We're really lucky to have so much good stuff being done by good people in the region that we can draw upon for RECON and I hope people will treat the festival as an opportunity to take risks on art and music that they might find challenging or unfamiliar. It's definitely a broad and diverse programme!"<br /><br />Venues taking part in RECON Festival include Howard Assembly Room, Brudenell Social Club, Delius Arts and Cultural Centre, Wharf Chambers, Hyde Park Picture House, The 1 in 12 Club, Victoria Gardens, Gallery II (University of Bradford), Fuse Art Space, Leeds West Indian Centre and The Tetley. <br /><br />More details about RECON Festival 2014 and the full schedule can be found at www.reconfest.co.uk.</p>
