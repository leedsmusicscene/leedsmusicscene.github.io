    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for Manning.</p>
    <p>"Manning produce an eclectic mix of music which broadly falls within the 'progressive' genre, but in reality spans many different musical forms from beautiful ballads and folk-tinged songs through to awesome all-out rock workouts and true progressive epics - no two songs sound the same!"<br /><br />The band has experienced a surge of interest and support, with the 2007 album "Songs From The Bilston House" having been nominated for Album of the Year by the Classic Rock Society (CRS) and a series of storming headline gigs in support of the critically acclaimed album, "Number Ten" (released 2009).<br /><br />Other members of Manning are Julie King (additional keyboards, percussion and backing vocals), Kris Hudson-Lee (bass), Dave Million (guitars and backing vocals), Martin Thiselton (keyboards) and Rick Henry (Drums & Percussion), David Wilkinson (Saxes, Flute and backing vocals). Such a sizeable line-up is able to fully reproduce the quintessentially symphonic Manning sound on stage.<br /><br />Manning have also been very fortunate in having some terrific musicians making special guest appearances on the albums including Andy Tillison (The Tangent and PO90), sax goddess Laura Fowles, Ian 'Walter' Fairbairn (Lindisfarne/Jack the Lad and Hedgehog Pie), Steve Dundon (Molly Bloom), Marek Arnold (Seven steps to the door and toxic smile), Angela Gordon (Mostly Autumn) and Martin Orford (IQ).<br /><br />2010 was a milestone breakthrough year for this remarkable band with some amazing festival slots including the first venture over the Atlantic to appear at the RoSfest in Gettysburg, PA. USA in May.<br /><br />The eleventh MANNING album "Charlestown" was released in Oct 2010 and was again nominated by both the CRS and the Italian ProgAwards for Album of the Year.<br /><br />2011 continued all the hard work with more UK dates and a brand new 12th studio album, the critically acclaimed, "Margaret's Children"<br /><br />2012 offered some European tour dates plus fabulous Summers End Festival and the 'Akoustik' Album release<br /><br />2013 more dates are already booked!.</p>
