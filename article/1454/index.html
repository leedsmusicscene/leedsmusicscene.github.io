    <p>Anyone doubt the power of fans? Certainly not Star Bodixa anyway. Democracy is alive and well amongst their rapidly-growing fanbase as seen in the band now reverting back to their original name of Bodixa.  An interesting move following the recent release of their debut LP under the old name, it seems that Bodixa fans (as they shall now be known again) preferred the original name so much the band had to bow to popular opinion. The five-piece have been back in Leeds recording their next single entitled Sapphire, whilst the album And They Danced On Glass has been wowing the press up and down the country. A short tour of Ireland is booked at the beginning of May before heading out on the road in the UK again.<BR><br>Bodixa's final gig in the local area for a little while is a low-key acoustic affair this Monday at The Blues Bar in Harrogate on Monday 10th March.  Support comes from York exciting songstress Hayley Hutchinson.</p>
