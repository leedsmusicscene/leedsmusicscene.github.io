    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "eatitfightitfuckit" recorded by Brazil. The review was written by Dave Sugden in 2001.</p>
    <p>Following their well-received "This Is Future-Wave" EP, Brazil have delivered yet another quality combination of guitar-pop tracks.  Two of the songs on this "eatitfightitfuckit" EP are top-drawer material, especially my favourite "School Daze".<Br><Br>Opening up the CD this three-minute classic track oozes energy of a Supergrass-esque nature; a comparison highlighted most by the delivery of the lyrics during the sing-along chorus "Should have done better in school".  Great track - I haven't heard anything as simple, yet as catchy and memorable as this in a long while.  "Strop-pop" say the band.  Yeah.<Br><BR>My other favourite is the final track "Razor Queen", a song about a gay superhero.  A bit more glam-punk rock; imagine a spangly guitar track with hints of the 70's in the vocals, perhaps Wire or Buzzcocks.  Another memorable chorus, another track you can join in with.<Br><Br>Sandwiched in between are two tracks that take a bit of a step back from the pace delivered elsewhere.  "Charmed" is a live recording, a bit lo-fi and experimental especially during the outro - whilst the main section of the song is a simple two-note bass line that eventually got on my nerves. Atmospheric vocals.  Nice and impressive, but not my thing.<Br><Br>Neither is "Sister Volume", the slow (er) song, though I liked this one a lot more than "Charmed" - even the rockier guitar moments are laid-back; the vocals are sung well, hit the notes when required and done it in yet another style. You couldn't pin Gwyn down even if you tried.<Br><Br>Brazil obviously work hard to avoid tracks being simple fillers, though "Charmed" came a little too close for me. A band who have set themselves high standards, Brazil are still hitting them... </p>
