    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for These Five Walls.</p>
    <p>These Five Walls are a five piece with a somewhat different take on the music that influences all of the band members. Centred in Leeds, the band has crafted a unique sound that blends together pop sensibilities with satisfyingly heavy riffing. Throw into the mix a punchy saxophone and often frenetic basslines and you have an idea of what These Five Walls are all about. <br /><br />Still in their infancy, the band is always looking for gigs in and around Leeds, but has already played in other regions within the North.<br /><br />This summer, their first jaunt to the recording studio proved fruitful, resulting in the 5 track EP, which demonstrates the diverse abilities of the band and manages to replicate the sound of These Five Walls live. Influences within the band range from Deftones to QOTSA, Pumpkins to Primus, Led Zep to Tool... the list is endless and also neglects the major factor that dance music has on the band's sound. <br /><br />Alternative rock is a major umbrella term, but one that would have to be used to describe the overall sound of the band; however, it is up to you to make your own evaluations and hear the EP or get down to one of the gigs!<br /><br />Line Up:<br /><br />Steven Gallivan - Lead Vocals/Rhythm Guitar<br />Harry Miller - Bass<br />Calum Watson - Lead Guitar/Backing Vocals<br />Jonny Gledhill - Drums<br />Tommy Cookson - Alto Sax.</p>
