    <p>Band - David Henshaw (vocals), Joseph Lawrenson (piano), Dan Fielding (electric guitar), Dominic Butler (violin) & Joe Montague (drums).<br /><br />Leeds five-piece Dancing Years who have recently picked-up support from the likes of Jen Long, Huw Stephens, Steve Lamacq, Mary Anne Hobbs and Amazing Radio, are building significant momentum after releasing their debut 7"single 'Here's to My Old Friends through a new French label ZRP / Roommates and in UK by Hide & Seek.<br /><br />2014 is shaping up to be an exciting year for Dancing Years, following a successful year in 2013 which saw them being shortlisted on the Independent's IoS Sound of 2013, tours with Jamie N Commons and Electric Soft Parade, playdates with Stornoway and Dry the River as well as a busy summer schedule performing at Great Escape, Dot to Dot, Deer Shed, Wilderness, andStandon Calling. In October they completed their first headline UK tour which included a sold out show at St Pancras Old Church in London, were invited on the first Sofar tour with Wolf Alice andSivu, played a spectacular debut show in Paris. More recently Dancing Years got their first European tour under their belts with Australia's Boy & Bear in March and have just toured the UK with George Ezra in June. <br /><br />"Stirring, melancholic, singalongs" - Q Magazine <br /><br />"They have mastered the dynamic between calming stillness and explosive euphoria, through the use of rich instrumentation and a strong voice." Drowned in Sound<br /><br />"You've got ones to watch right here people" 8/10 (live review from Great Escape 2013) - There Goes The Fear<br /><br />"Dancing Years destroying a sweltering Good Mixer with cataclysmic folk" - The Guardian.</p>
