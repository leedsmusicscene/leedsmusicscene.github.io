        <h1>Herdwhite - Lost In The Big City</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Lost In The Big City" recorded by Herdwhite. The review was written by David Brookmyre in 2007.</p>
    <p>I’m bombarded with a soundscape of guitars, synths, samples, beats, male/female vocals and industrious effects. Herdwhite’s skittish synths and robust beats juxtapose life with urbanity. “All Out Aggression”, an agilmente 3 minute pathological brainstorm narrates of an aggressive mute. Facing the music, standing up and being counted, that's the concept. “A Major” overdriving guitar then triangulates into the synthesised solo. A crescendo is stagnantly interrupted by a stale percussion. A fierce vocal stoically roars into the 16 bar instrumental of tremolo’s. The filtrations bounce from ear to ear producing a shift in gear and poise. The songs have repeating verses and certainly wouldn’t be out of place as part of a film score. Such is the constant repletion of ideas.<br><br>“Lost In the Big City” with its benevolent opening, chimes its way into your spirit. The fastidious composition announces a far eastern credo. A story of isolation and paranoia, the sweeping vocals, interchanging between male and female overlapping a more altogether accomplished and varied rhythmic backing track. There is an authentic choice on eastern instruments and scales. Feeding the light flavour is bird song, sprinkled over the Appassionato filled piece. A confusable flapping of the vocals during the outro perhaps symbolises a confusion and helplessness? But it does somehow go against what the previous 4 minutes were about.  At times overpowering Herdwhite’s “Lost In The Big City” and “All Out Aggression” are academically proven and produced to a professional standard. Sometimes failing to avoid the pitfalls of cliché ideas there is rich vocals, creative music and sound technology applied to pieces perhaps lacking in melodies with definition. The insightful drum arrangements and adventurous sampling in these big beat tracks is what its about. Though maybe less sonic tweaking and more honest feeling and musical inspiration is what is needed. The two songs are of real contrast and mark the versatility of Herdwhite.</p>
