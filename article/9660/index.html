    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for Ghosts in the Nightclub.</p>
    <p>We started out in March 2007 recording songs in our flat. We had a song called Ghosts in the Nightclub and because we didn't get out that much we thought it would fit as both a description of where we were at the time and the odd/paranoid nature of the lyrics. We got more tech savvy as the year went on, the recordings improved and decided to get some gigs. We played a few shows throughout the year, we were swapping round instruments and making a bit of a messy racket in the pubs and clubs of Leeds. It's punk rock with a drum machine, wailing guitars and thunderous bass; but not always loud..</p>
