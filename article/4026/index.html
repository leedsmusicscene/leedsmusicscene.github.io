    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for Dead Disco.</p>
    <p>Dead Disco are Victoria Hesketh (vocals/ keyboards), Marie France (bass/ backing vocals) and Lucy Catherwood (guitar). The band formed at school: the only one for miles, as it happened, somewhere left of the middle of nowhere at the heart of North Yorkshire. There was little to do so Marie and Lucy decided to start a band. Eventually they arrived at art school in Leeds and placed an ad on a Leeds music website which both the girls knew, from bitter experience, would most likely throw up a deluge of freaks, losers and opportunists. Instead, happily, it produced Victoria. With less than a handful of songs under their collective Dead Disco belt the band started gigging. One of their first performances was at Manchester's In The City, leading to a recording stint in with James Ford (Simian Mobile Disco) in his London attic studio. The outcome was the limited issue debut 'The Treatment' in early 2006, which instantly filled indie dance floors up and down the country including heavy rotation at London's Trash. The track 'City Place' was released digitally through Playlouder Recordings. Radio sessions for both Radio 1's Steve Lamacq and Xfm's John Kennedy followed, as did sold out gigs and an appearance at the Leeds festival. The release of 'Automatic', the last ever single on Fierce Panda, firmly established them as one of the UK most exciting new bands, and not long after they signed with 679 Recordings/ Warner Music. The band are currently making their debut album in LA with well respected producer Greg Kurstin (Gwen Stefani, Flaming Lips, Peaches, Lily Allen)..</p>
