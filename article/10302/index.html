    <p>Ben   -   Vocals/Guitar<br />Ste    -   Guitar/Vocals<br />Stiv   -   Bass/Vocals<br />Pete -   Drums<br /><br />Since their conception ACiD DROP have clawed away not stop at the UK scene with their energentic and riotous blend of hardcore/Skate/folk/ska punk. <br /><br /><br />Formed in late 2007 and taking their lead from the likes of Bad Religion, NoFX, The Dropkick Murphy's and Street Dogs, ACiD DROP have come to support some big names in Punk and Rock including Random Hand, Voodoo Glow Skulls, Sonic Boom Six, Architects, The Computers, Anvil, Lawnmower Deth, The Flatliners, Stza Crack and the UK Subs. <br /><br /><br />The devastating combination of ACiD DROP's sound has lead them to rub shoulders with rock royalty with a legendary performance at DOWNLOAD FESTIVAL 2009, and following up with two impressive performances at the REBELLION PUNK FESTIVAL in Blackpool <br /><br /><br />Along the way ACiD DROP have recorded their Debut Album "THE DROPZONE" leading to rave reviews, BBC Introducing sessions, plays on BBC Radio One's Mike Davies Punk Show as well as plays on BBC Leeds, York and Humberside, an appearance on Big Cheese Magazine's "Loudest of 2010" compilation cover CD and a "Blast" feature in the May 2010 issue. ACiD DROP rounded up 2010 with a bang playing alongside Random Hand and The Skints as part of The Slam Dunk Ska Punk all-dayer at The Cockpit in Leeds.  <br /><br /><br />2011 will see the release of ACiD DROP's eagerly awaited new LEP "FULL DECK?" it features seven rip roaring tracks which will hit stores and iTunes in December.  <br /> <br /><br /><br />REVIEWS <br /><br />The first thing that struck me about this band was their sheer energy and enthusiasm. The crowd were there with them too, Acid Drop rallied their troops up into a frenzy claiming "if you're not gonna start anything then we will". At every opportunity the lead singer ran into the crowd and a mass jig soon followed. - James Burkitt - Leeds Music Scene<br /><br /><br />To say they've got chemistry on stage is an understatement. It's more like the entire Periodic Table thrown into a blender. by Henry Raby - Push To Fire <br /><br /><br />By far the stand out band of the day, I couldn't help but join in the fun. Crowd surfing, mosh pits, human pyramids and a whole load of jigging. by Craig Slaney - Shattered Glass Media Magazine. <br /><br /><br />We are due an underdog band to win a big one and who is to say it won't be these guys. You'd be a fool to place your hard earned brass elsewhere. by Dave - Fungalpunk, June 2010<br /><br /> <br /><br />If you needed proof that UK punk is thriving then look no further than ACiD DROP." by Tim Grayson - Big Cheese Magazine Issue 120, May 2010 <br /><br /><br />These are BRILLIANTLY crafted songs which frequently transcend their folk-punk roots. There is a tremendous versatility to this band which has not been apparent (to me at least) elsewhere. by Gardinski - Sheffield Music Scene.</p>
