    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for Louisa Osborn.</p>
    <p>A 19 year old female singer-songwriter originally from Southampton.  From an early age she's always enjoyed singing.  Learning to play the guitar as a first instrument not only triggered teaming singing with guitar playing, but also song writing for Louisa.  She then discovered writing songs for herself wasn't a bad idea!  Now starting to build up a repertoire of original compositions and arrangements of covers she liked gigging seemed like the next place to go. <br /><br />Louisa studied her passion of music firstly at college in Southampton, where she studied a BTEC National and then went on to study a BA Hons popular music studies degree in Leeds, at the Leeds College of Music, which she is now going into  her second year of.  <br /><br />Having played many gigs in and around the Southampton area and having supported many different artists including big names like the winner of T4's unsigned act 2009 Tommy Reilly and independant BBC Welsh artist Rod Thomas.   <br /><br />"Any good written song can influence me whatever style it may be, but some artists that are particularly influential to me are female guitar rockers like KT Tunstall, Missy Higgins, Laura Marling, Lisa Hannigan, and also folky artists like Lou Rhodes, Kate Rusby, Joanna Newsom and Mumford and Sons"¬ù.</p>
