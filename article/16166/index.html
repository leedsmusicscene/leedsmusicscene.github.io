    <p>Having previously announced that they were working with Wild Beasts' producer Richard Formby, Leeds band I Like Trains have now released further details on their third album.<br /><br />'The Shallows' will be released through Leeds' label ILR on 7th May. It is now available for pre-order and as always the band are offering a variety of options.<br /><br />The standard album pre-order on CD or vinyl will be signed by the band, and sent out before its conventional release date. <br /><br />A deluxe album option includes a signed CD or vinyl, the download, name in the album credits and an exclusive screen print. In addition everyone pre-ordering the deluxe option will be entered into a draw for a one off scrap book of the band's recording. This will be packed with Polaroid photos, lyric sheets, plectrums and more.<br /><br />All physical purchases will include the digital download for free and will receive this as soon as it's ready.<br /><br />In recent interviews lead singer Dave Martin has hinted that the band have experimented more with their sound with a greater use of synths on this record while historical subject matter has made way for lyrics more focused on modern technology and the worrying grip it holds over us all.<br /><br />Pre-order now from from the ILR store.</p>
