    </div>
    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2010.</p>
    <p>Louise Distras has announced the release of her three track 'Spiders' EP. The release will be the debut record from the former Blockades front woman. <br /><br />Heralding from Wakefield, Louise has quickly earned herself a reputation as one of the hardest working solo acts with a constant stream of shows across the country, most notably those for BBC Raw Talent and Manchester's Our House TV.<br /><br />Often described as the female Frank Carter, Louise has garnered critical acclaim for her brand of honest acoustic folk rock but it quickly becomes apparent that this isn't your typical female artist. Straight from the opening first track "Spiders" barrage of articulate, thoughtful and yet acerbic lyricism irrevocably grabs you by the throat threatening to break you in two at a moment's notice.<br /><br />On paper this is a folk EP. In reality it's the DIY Punk roots that take a forefront throughout the EP with Louise's anti-folk lyrical themes cutting straight to the bone at every opportunity tackling the underlying themes of life, love and everything in between.<br /><br />'Spiders' will be released through Dapsone Records on November 15th and will be available for download through iTunes, Napster, Amazon and Spotify.</p>
