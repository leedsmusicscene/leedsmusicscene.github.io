    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for The Kingcrows.</p>
    <p>THE KINGCROWS (Phil E Stine - vocals, Lee J - guitar, Rocco - bass and Ratbag - drums) are a band determined to do their own thing their own way. Combining the energy of punk, the flash of sleaze and the sheer reckless abandon of being in a band with no aspirations towards a career or commercial acceptance - simply the rush of playing noisy, filthy rock 'n' roll for the pure hell of it - they fire off compact bursts of concentrated rock fury, infused with a wicked sense of humour.<br />..<br />Since 2006 the Kingcrows have torn up the stages of the North with many notable bands including Spear Of Destiny, UK Subs, Anti Nowhere League, Tokyo Dragons, Adam Bomb, Guitar Gangsters, the Vibrators and Peter & The Test Tube Babies, as well as innumerable other local, national and international acts. They also appeared at the massive Nice N Sleazy punk festival in Morecambe in 2010. The band have so far released two 7-track EPs - Carrion Regardless in 2008 (now deleted) and A Murder Most Foul in 2009, plus a single ("Magdelene" b/w "Insult & Injury" and "In For The Kill") in 2010. The latter two in particular were exceptionally well-received and have been released for worldwide download via iTunes, Amazon, eMusic, Play.com and all other major channels. <br />..<br />The Kingcrows intend to spread their insanity further and bring their manic, fun rock 'n' roll show to as many people as possible. Be ready..</p>
