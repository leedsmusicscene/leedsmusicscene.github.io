        <h1>The Passing Fancy - Talking Sense Blues</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Talking Sense Blues" recorded by The Passing Fancy. The review was written by Jessica Thornsby in 2009.</p>
    <p>'Talking Sense Blues,' the debut single from Wakefield's 'The Passing Fancy' is folkish indie with infectious percussion and hand-clapping sound effects. If that knee-jiggling beat is 'Talking Sense Blues's greatest strength, then the straightforward, everyman lyrics are a close second. The chorus of "and I'm sorry, don't know what else to do / I just don't wanna hang around with you no more" is refreshingly unpretentious, and frontman's Paul Bateson's straight-talking delivery makes for quirky and comical listening.<br /><br />  'Talking Sense Blues' is goodtimes, harmonica-coated folk music with charming lyrics, and it just may see The Passing Fancy worm their way into the affections of those who wouldn't normally listen to folk. <br /><br />  Like 'Talking Sense Blues,' B-side 'Suburban Lovesick Blues' gets that all-important base beat spot-on, with a simple, twitchy acoustic guitar providing rock-solid foundations. Also like the A-side, 'Suburban Lovesick Blues's lyrics are likeably to-the-point, an ethos that compliments the song's no-frills folk sound. Bursts of harmonica and a gradual, mid-verse swell of a secondary acoustic guitar, provides the only bit of variation necessary.<br /><br />  Bonus live track 'Rambler Gambler, is a twinkly acoustic ballad that meanders prettily along for the first half, before the introduction of snappy, hand-clapping beats sees The Passing Fancy pick up the pace. Frontman Bateson's vocals are impressive to say this is a live recording. In fact, if it wasn't for a less-than-polished edge to the harmonica, you probably wouldn't guess this was a live recording at all. 'Rambler Gambler' bodes well for The Passing Fancy as a live proposition.<br /><br />  The Passing Fancy's debut single offers up three tracks of charismatic, low-key indie-folk. It's far from earth-shattering, but just how unshowy it is, is actually pretty refreshing, and makes it the perfect accompaniment to a quiet summer's afternoon.</p>
