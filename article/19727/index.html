    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2016.</p>
    <p>Leeds, based Alternative Rock band Young Amphibians are set to release their exciting new EP titled Junked Up Heart on the 24th February 2017.<br /><br />This is Young Amphibians' second EP, the follow up to their 2014 debut EP 'Thought Control'. The lead single from Junked Up Heart, End of Today, Start of Tomorrow has been described by LMS as "Tasty licks, hard hitting drums and a guitar solo to get lost in, keeps this track speeding across the airwaves, leaving behind it a trail of dust and destruction".<br /><br />The release will be celebrated with a launch show at 360 Club, Leeds on Friday 24th February. The EP will be available via all major online stores & streaming sites such as iTunes, Spotify, Amazon Music & Bandcamp from the 24th February. Physical CDs and 12" vinyl are available to purchase at the 360 Club on the night as well as viceroyrecords.bigcartel.com.<br /><br />"When I first sat down to begin work on Junked Up Heart, I wanted it to become a piece that anyone could relate to, no matter what background you are from or what age you are, I knew that it needed to resonate in the listener's heart long after the record had finished. The concept that would eventually come is that of the desire we feel every day. The need for more out of life or the fear that we are not achieving our potential. It's a long hard look in the mirror. A gut-wrenching flash of the past" Thom P Smith - Frontman<br /><br />Launch show details:<br />Friday 24th February 2017<br />360 Club - Lending Room @ The Library, Leeds.<br />Doors 8 pm<br />Tickets Â£5 ADV from Jumbo Records, CRASH Records or Young Amphibians.<br /><br />"A band who were born to be superstars" - Guardian<br /><br />"If you are into rock with an indie twist then these guys are perfect for your summer playlist" - United By Pop</p>
