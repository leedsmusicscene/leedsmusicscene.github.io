        <h1>The Somatics - Dynamo Mercurial</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Dynamo Mercurial" recorded by The Somatics. The review was written by Chris Woolford in 2006.</p>
    <p>Insert the second album from Leeds’ band The Somatics. Turn volume to a loud but enjoyable seven point five.  Press play. Close eyes and imagine a large, luscious green field.<Br><br>It’s 1970, it’s summer, and you are at the Isle of Wight Festival. You are no longer an office based worker. You are, what is affectionately known as, a hippy.<Br><br>As the sun sets you stare at the stars becoming clear in the luscious red sky.  In your blissed out state you feel the effects of the acid you took a few minutes earlier taking hold of your senses.  Your arms held aloft, stretched open-wide like a soaring eagle, you spin round and round in an awkward circle, happy to be alive.<Br><br>Beautiful harmonies ring through your ears taking you higher and higher. Pounding drums rock your head from side-to-side.  Crashing guitars throw your body around like a writhing animal. Your brain pulses then pulses again. You are lost in a trance of complete and utter ecstasy.<Br><br>Stop!<Br><br>Christ! I’m only on track three and already openers Mercury Rising and Elemental have sent me into the most amazing trance of pure, unadulterated, hedonistic happiness.<Br><br>Play!<Br><br>Mmmmm…<Br><br>[Some time later]<Br><br>Spin… spin… spin… spin…<Br><br>Stop!<Br><br>Urrr… I feel like I’ve lost several days of my life. But I’ve only been out for a little less than an hour.<Br><br>I’m completely sober on a dull Sunday afternoon and The Somatics have taken me to another world through their stunning mystical and psychedelic retro pop.<Br><br>If this album had been released 30 years ago it would have made The Somatics legends.  It really is that good.<Br><br>Right, I’m off for another hit…<Br><br>…woosh!</p>
