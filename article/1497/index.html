    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2003.</p>
    <p>Now that the location for Leeds Festival 2003 have been determined (Bramham Park for those that missed it), attention now turns to Futuresound 2003 which gives six local bands the opportunity to take to the festival stages alongside their favourite UK and international bands and musicians.<br><br>In previous years thirty bands have been selected to go forward into the heat stage (a series of live shows) and this year seems no different. The six bands with the highest score, based on independent judges and audience votes, will play at the festival and the overall winner is also set to win musical equipment from Academy of Sound.<br><br>To enter you will need to pick up an application form from Jumbo, Crash or The Cockpit and submit it to the organisers before Friday, June 6th. Various conditions apply to entries this year, such as being resident of West Yorkshire, etc so read those rules carefully before entering.</p>
