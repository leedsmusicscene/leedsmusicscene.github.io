    <p>We both went to primary school together and for that whole time were the best of friends. When Malaki was 13 years old he moved with his mother and sisters to Seattle in the US. We ended up losing contact and for many years grew up in very different environments. The main thing we had in common for all this time was indifference to the schooling system. Whilst we were both intelligent young people we felt excluded from our surroundings. I myself got expelled from my High School for smoking cannabis at 13 and moved to another High School where I knew no one. Nether of us achieved academic success and found ourselves wondering where our lives where going. Malaki moved back to Leeds a couple of years back. We soon hooked up and ever since have been working towards our album ieGo..</p>
