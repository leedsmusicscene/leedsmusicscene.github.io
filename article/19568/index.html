    <p>Steven Elvidge (mob-orator)<br />Geoff Taylor (all nite bass frequencies)<br />Neil Howson (power-noise generator)<br />Jan Perry (beat dominator)<br />Charles Hutchinson (singer on Mecca)<br /><br />Age Of Chance were an alternative rock / indie dance band from Leeds, England active from 1985 to 1991. They are perhaps most known for their mutant metallic cover of Prince's "Kiss" that topped the indie chart in 1986 but narrowly missed being a crossover mainstream hit at the beginning of 1987, reaching only #50 in the U.K. Despite signing for major label Virgin and being favourites with the music press, they never enjoyed a pop hit. However, their single "Don't Get Mad... Get Even!" reached #5 in the U.S. dance Chart. The group has also been cited as musically ahead of their time by dance-based indie groups that rose to fame in the early 90s / late 80s.<br /><br />Musically, they were a sonic collision of punk, hip hop, industrial rock, northern soul, and more. Singer Steven E provided a distinctive strident nasal vocal style, often employing a megaphone. Striking cover art visuals were a collaboration between the group and The Designers Republic, who would go on to graphic design fame. They were contemporaries of Pop Will Eat Itself whose music also featured rock guitar, dance beats and copious samples and other early UK samplist groups such as Coldcut and The JAMMs..</p>
