        <h1>Parisman - The Answer To Example 1</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "The Answer To Example 1" recorded by Parisman. The review was written by Danny Martin in 2004.</p>
    <p>First off, lets get the cards on the table. Parisman's music style didn't seem like it was gonna float my boat at all. But hang on if you're a fan; don't throw yer teddies out of the cot yet. Second off, and more importantly, this single is stunning.<br><br>Parisman have produced one hell of a cut which smashes thorough every confinement you could wish to throw at them. Utterly scatty and occasionally frantic, slap them with a specific genre tag at you're peril. Parisman are Parisman and it's that simple. Love them or hate them you will be blown away.<br><br>"This is for your neighbours" starts proceedings riotously. Bearing the same jittery makeup which runs flawlessly throughout.  A mighty guitar intro, which crashes seamlessly into the effortless vocals of Shaun Holloran and James Scholes. The song gathers up and then falls away majestically, on the surface a snappy pitbull of a tune but tear the skin off and the undertone is much calmer. Both vocals and synths combining to create a solid backbone.<br><br>"White Russians" is a totally new baby, and one which just needs cuddling. The vocals on this tune are beautiful, almost haunting. Something which appears to be deliberate. Luring you deeper into the heady synth and effects laden world where Parisman have laid their roots.  I wasn't really sure what to think of its cautious makeup, but think I did. After a few spins it captured me, this tune is going to be on my playlist for a good few months to come. And there's not a damn thing I would do to change that. Remarkable.<br><br>After the virtual trauma of "White Russians" up steps "Loosely connected". Another deliberate mind messing attempt with yet more uncompromised dirty synth pads and disturbed vocal effects. Ah hell, though I'm getting used to these guys. "Somebody please, think I'm falling in. I don't think so, I think your falling in" wails Hollaran. Yep damn right mate I am.<br><br>So there, do with that what you will. I don't usually like synths; I don't usually like high-end smooth vocals. I'm definitely not normally fond of the laidback, thinking man's music. But then maybe I've just been overexposed to half-arsed attempts to do what Parisman are attempting and create a unique sound for the public to sway to. Yep I think that's it, I have seen bands like Parisman before, I have listened to their music, and I have been left dazed and confused.<br><br>"The answer to example 1" has left me speechless.</p>
