    <p>Rupert is no stranger to the Leeds music scene and his powerful vocal has garnered support from XFM, BBC 6 Music and Radio 2, amassing fans along the way.  His broad musical appeal has gained support slots for Gabrielle Aplin and James Blunt amongst many others.    <br /><br />Rupert is now ready to release his new EP, Talk To You, four tracks of gritty, Northern passion with the kind of big-sky choruses that Richard Ashcroft or Elbow would be proud of.  <br /><br />The title track and lead single, Rupert explains, is "about a girl, of course. I'd been seeing her for a few months but I broke it off as I thought the time wasn't right to have a girlfriend. Of course, when it came down to it, all I could think about was her."  Like Rupert's previous releases, this EP, on his own Xidus label, is a product his musical partnership with producer Will Jackson (Kaiser Chiefs, The Cribs, Pigeon Detectives).<br /><br />The Talk To You EP is available for pre-order NOW on iTunes <br /><br />You can see Rupert Stroud live on the 19th March at Belgrave Music Hall supporting Hunter and the Bear and at his EP Launch gig at The Wardrobe on April 17th.<br /><br />Track Listing:<br />1. Talk To You<br />2. Morning Light<br />3. It All Comes Back<br />4. Light It Up</p>
