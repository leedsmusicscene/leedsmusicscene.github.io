        <h1>Tiny Giants - Shades of Grey</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Shades of Grey" recorded by Tiny Giants. The review was written by Adam Hutcheson in 2010.</p>
    <p>Recovering well from a borderline cliche title, the Tiny Giants strut through a kind of 'Jack Black' rock anthem- their image as live performers stabs into my mind. It's punchy without ever really hitting, it strokes through a well structured single. At times the drummer's cymbals distract from the excellent lyrics but I really get a feel for the group's attitude as soon as half way through. They break down and drop with a skill that makes me want to see them in front of me. "When there's drama in my life / I like the suspense" reflects this.<br /><br />Going forward, I'd like to hear some more layers to the sound; some electronics; some Kasabian background noise, some technology. At the moment it seems slightly Lo-Fi, but without the warm, John Cusack, vinyl factor. Basically I just want some musical equivalent of  'goal line technology' to make me feel like it's new, and not stuck in a past genre.<br /><br />Arguably, this might be what sets them apart from other comparable 'genre mixing' acts - but I feel with some work, it could really propel some quality, provocative and relatable song-writing.</p>
