        <h1>Wrestling Jacob - The Darkened Glass EP</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "The Darkened Glass EP" recorded by Wrestling Jacob. The review was written by Gavin Miller in 2005.</p>
    <p>Hmmmm… too much of this smacks of the one genre that strikes fear into the most hardened music fan, Christian Rock. It’s all there - the pictures of band members in churches, and the religious imagery in the title and the band’s name.<bR><BR>Whether this has anything to do with the big man upstairs or not, it’s still quite a pleasant listen. Maybe not my cup of tea, but I can see why people would like it-  there’s passionate vocals, soaring chorus moments, inch perfect production values, etc.<bR><BR>Tracks like ‘Eye Opener’ graciously slide along, even if it’s more Middle of the Road Radio 3 fodder than anything else, ‘Virus’ sounds like an acoustic Evanescence, but with a baritone vocal, ‘Afford Your Friends’ is more understated harmonies, with drowsy, semi- conscious organ riffs and guitar lines, but it’s ‘Time to Move On’ that lets them down a bit. The rest of the EP slides along gently, the kind of music your mum or dad would happily listen to, but the brash funk of said track was probably not a very good idea.<bR><BR>Aside from that, the EP is a fine example of a band that’s obviously not about to blow anyone’s mind with 20 minute long epics or alternatively spit and snarl about coke and booze parties, but if having a nice cup of tea with a scone is your idea of rock ‘n roll, then you may have your ideal soundtrack right here.</p>
