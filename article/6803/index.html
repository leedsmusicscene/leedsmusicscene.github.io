    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for Ali Whitton and the Broke Record Players.</p>
    <p>Following a successful few years gigging as a four-piece that still went under Ali's name, the line-up of his new band was finalised in early 2006.  His aim was to make the live performances more addictive to an audience by playing on the dynamics of the music, making the quieter bits more ambient and making the louder bits crueller and affecting.  The new line-up consists of Naomi Abbt (22) on viola, Tim Child's (19) on drums, Tim Corbridge (26) on lap steel and guitar, James Heggie (29) on bass guitar, Lee Potter (23) on guitar, mandolin, and piano, Sam Stockdale (21) singing backing vocals, and Ali Whitton (23) on rhythm guitar and vocals.<br /><br />They are releasing their début EP entitled "Empty Threats and Recurring Themes" in late May 2006..</p>
