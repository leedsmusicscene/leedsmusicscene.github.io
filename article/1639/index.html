    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for Nerve Engine.</p>
    <p>In the fashionista driven world of modern rock music, Nerve Engine are that most sought after rarity, a band driven by passion, hunger, desire and most importantly, honesty.<br />
<br />
With the release of 'Red Son Rising', Nerve Engine have created an EP of blistering songs, sizzling with energy, forged on the foundations of everything the band are renowned for. Soaring melodies are layered over thundering, riff-driven metal, all expertly executed and delivered with fury and power. It's the sound of a band fighting back from adversity to create something truly special, all wrapped up in 21 minutes of hook laden anthems guaranteed to stay with you from the very first listen...<br />
<br />
As the quality of Nerve Engine's song writing has reached the next level, so has the live show, blistering in it's intensity and energy. Building on their already impressive list of shows, including stints with Breed77, Panic Cell, Antiproduct, The Butterfly Effect, Twin Zero and Engine Down, Nerve Engine have just completed their first full UK tour in support of 'Red Son Rising', beginning with a headline show at London's famous Garage venue and will be embarking on at least three further tours in 2006.<br />
<br />
With Nerve Engine's rapidly rising national profile, a fanbase increasing every day and a confidence that only comes with complete belief in their musicianship and songwriting, 2006 looks like it could be their year, and with the interests of the UK's underground music scene in mind, it couldn't come at a better time....</p>
