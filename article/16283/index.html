        <h1>Radio Partizan - We Interrupt This Broadcast...</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "We Interrupt This Broadcast..." recorded by Radio Partizan. The review was written by Joe Scrase in 2012.</p>
    <p>I'm afraid I need to start with a few confessions of mine. It was late one night, and I had been in meetings all day with some very demanding people, it was then that I got home to a large pile of post, "oh sod it" I exclaimed.  After all it probably wasn't anything important.  <br /><br />Now I may have done some stupid stuff in my life, however to ignore a parcel containing one of the best albums ever written (also containing a lovely note from the band may I add) is right up there on my list of stupid things to date, coincidently just below eating a bacon sarnie in the presence of Morrissey last summer in Leeds (words of advice, DON'T DO IT!)<br /><br />The second on my list of confessions is as follows, although it is beautifully written and it is evident a lot of time has been invested in mastering it, I have absolutely no idea what to class it as! I'm thinking maybe hallucinogenic, political, alternative, punk? Or is that too long? I'm just struggling to think of a name that will do it justice. <br /><br />In all seriousness, it's songs such as Hooooo Guru that make me love life. The lyrics seem to be completely nonsensical however with every listen I manage to gain another new word as created by the Leeds three piece. <br /><br />From a band so interested and driven by political change it's interesting to see them use social media. As quoted from their Facebook page on a music video "Radical Feminist Anglo-Romanian Punk Anthem" if anyone has any idea as to the thinking behind this or its meaning please let me know, it sounds mighty intriguing. <br /><br />How to describe the album in 10 possibly 11 words? Let me think. Maybe "Anger fuelled political rampage with the use of non-standard English". Yeah, that sounds about right. <br />We interrupt this Broadcast is available from all good retailers (except the one you're thinking about, but then that's just life).</p>
