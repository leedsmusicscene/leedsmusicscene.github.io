Whilst playing open mic nights around Leeds they stumbled upon a bass player and drummer seeking a new band, with Daniel Prothero on bass guitar and Marty Delaney on drums the band played extensively around the Leeds area building up a reputation as one of the finest up and coming blues acts in the city.<br /><br />In summer 2011, Marty and Daniel left paving the way for local Leeds lad Daniel Lewis to take over on bass guitar and Parisian drummer Georges Delajoux to complete the line up on drums..</p>
