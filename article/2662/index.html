        <h1>The Victor Surge - Untitled</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Untitled" recorded by The Victor Surge. The review was written by Richard Garnett in 2004.</p>
    <p>Statement or stupidity? Let's give them the benefit of the doubt. "One take thru one mic live recording" says the inlay, it may aswell say "Yes we know this sounds sh*te but we're still cheeky enough to ask for a review".<br><br>So my review may as well say "You knew it sounded sh*te so what did you expect me to say?". Below the distorting mic and the booming speaker muffle there may actually be some decent songs but who knows, and after one hearing who cares? Here-in lies The Victor Surge's mistake! Like the band who cries wolf, by the time they actually put their hands in their pockets and record properly, who is going to want to buy one based on past performances?<br><br>It's insulting to all the other bands out there to think that this should be reviewed on an equal footing with such poor production values, well it has and let's hope they like the result.</p>
