    <p>‘A fine example of British rock music at its best. Dusty Not Digital may just play an important part in the British music scene in the not too distant future.’ Leeds Music Scene.<br />
<br />
Formed in the depths of a basement in late 2005 by songwriters Luke Hirst &amp; Lewys Rees, Dusty Not Digital are a sonically adventurous indie alt-rock band hailing from their hometown of Bradford. Influenced by the likes of The Flaming Lips, Muse, Soulwax &amp; Radiohead, the bands aim is simple - write great songs and take them on to the live circuit.<br />
<br />
Now with a full band formed with Ween on bass &amp; Adam Dimuantes on drums, Dusty Not Digital's explosive stage show combines everything from screaming guitars to church organs and has been described as being 'full of nervous, raunchy energy' by Sandman Magazine, 'Almighty Prog Mentalism' by Mono and more recently 'Immense' by Random Magazine.<br />
<br />
In May 2006 DND successfully beat 39 other bands to be crowned winners of the Musicians Centre battle of the bands. Heats took place in Leeds &amp; Bradford, the final was held at Keighley’s 1200 capacity venue Victoria Hall.<br />
<br />
After months of hard graft and constant gigging, DND are building up a strong local following with one eye firmly on the future.<br />
<br />
Now with the release of their debut 2-track demo, produced by MTV legend TimG, Dusty Not Digital hope to attract record label attention..</p>
