    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2017.</p>
    <p>Legendary Leeds label Dance To The Radio are back and have announced the return of their 4x12" vinyl compilation series with a new release scheduled for the 21st April, just in time for Record Store Day.<br /> <br />The Leeds label, who have released records from bands like Forward Russia, I Like Trains, and Grammatics announced its return in 2016 with a new album from The Pigeon Detectives.<br /> <br />For the first instalment of the newly revived format, four Yorkshire artists will be stepping up to contribute a single. Self-styled trash punk trio Dead Naked Hippies will lead the release followed by the psychedelic mad-men of FLING who will be performing at the Brudenell Social Club on Monday 23rd January following Steve Lamacq's live broadcast from the venue as part of Independent Venue Week. Making up the second half of the compilation is the brilliant & gloomy electronic pop of singer and producer LAMIA and arty odd-ball recluses The Tiny Minds.<br /> <br />Sally Bryant, the new A&R Representative for Dance To The Radio explains what the label has in store: "The return of the Dance to the Radio 4x12" compilation is a really exciting thing for new music. I can't wait for these artists to make their own mark on the city's brilliant music scene. We're really looking forward to unearthing the next set of great artists in our city."<br /> <br />To celebrate the release of this compilation, each of the artists featured will host their own events in and around Leeds in collaboration with Dance To The Radio. Dead Naked Hippies will be curating shows in Leeds city centre, while Fling will launch a monthly residency at Milo, one of the cities most beloved rock bar's, and The Tiny Minds will curate a show in their hometown's own legendary venue, Hebden Bridge Trades Club.</p>
