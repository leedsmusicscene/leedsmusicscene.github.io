Among its other members were Jonny Cragg (drums) who later found global fame in Spacehog and Jeremy Dyson who became known for being a member of the team who wrote The League of Gentlemen.

The band supported The Cult in May 1984 and later that year put out a great single Presentation--"The Thickest Head."<br /><br />Band Members - Jonny Cragg (also played in The Hollow Men, Spacehog, Arckid & The Twenty Twos), Jackie Chambers, Jeremy Dyson, Jon Hayes, Glen Barker, Jon Roberts, John Darwin, Rab Letham.</p>
