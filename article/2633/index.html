    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for Graceadelica.</p>
    <p>Graceadelica are a four piece hailing from Leeds, West Yorkshire. After just re-mastering the 'ON EP' the band have now set their sights on working their new EP 'How I lost My Self Respect ' for 2005/06. The Graceadelica sound is an infuriatingly catchy mix of singing guitars, awesome melodic synths, crashing drums complimented by dancy basslines and cleverly worked haunting vocals.<br><br>The songs on the current EP are all written and performed by Graceadelica. Their home recorded demo was recorded at Gracadelica's self built Studio.<br><br>Recent reviews have compared the bands sound to a hybrid of The Killers, The Music, U2 and The Verve and have also commented on how the line between dance, indie and rock are brilliantly blurred.<Br><br>They have also headlined many gigs in Leeds including HMV and Black Market Music Showcases.<Br><br>Graceadelica have a strong following, many students at Leeds University descend upon venues to attend Graceadelica gigs. Graceadelica also have a knack of impressing 'first time' listeners and have a strong yet still growing fan base in Leeds, Manchester and York.<br><br>This year the band will be working on their new EP and showcasing their new songs on the Leeds, Manchester and London music scenes..</p>
