    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2009.</p>
    <p>After a couple of rogue websites claimed to be selling tickets for Leeds Festival 2009, event organisers Festival Republic have this week warned everyone wishing to attend this year’s festival that tickets are not currently on sale.<br><br>Although some early bird tickets were released last August, these have all been sold out and the main allocation of festival tickets will not go on sale until late March 2009. Any site claiming to be selling tickets now is not only unauthorised but are very unlikely to actually have any tickets allocated to them.<br><br>Leeds Festival tickets always go on sale on the night of the line-up announcement, usually at 6.45pm, and to avoid music fans’ disappointment, organisers have also released details of the official agencies that will be authorised to sell tickets for the event.<br><br>For online sales, would-be festival goers are recommended to visit one of the two main UK ticket outlets, See Tickets or Ticketmaster.<br><br>You can also buy your tickets over the phone by calling the festival telephone booking line on 0871 2310821. If you want to buy in person, visit Jumbo Records, Crash Records or HMV in the Leeds City Centre.<br><br>For the full list of approved ticket agencies visit our Leeds Festival mini-site.</p>
