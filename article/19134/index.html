    <p>Behind the scenes at LMS there has been a lot going on.  We have been incredibly busy expanding the Editorial team to make sure we can get to more gigs and review more of the music you love.<br /><br />I would like you to welcome Neil Chapman as our Photo Editor.  Neil is a familiar face and has been working with Leeds Music Scene as long as we have been online and is an integral part of the Team.  He has been responsible for some of the most amazing images from the events we have covered, anything from local gigs, to Festivals like Live at Leeds and Leeds Festival.  He has also created some amazing feature images, like the Allusondrugs photo feature.  Neil works closely with the Leeds Music Trust and supports young bands, so we are thrilled to have him on the Editorial team.<br /><br />Neil can be found at photos [ at ] leedsmusicscene.net<br /><br />After losing our YouTube and Playlist Editor to Japan, it has taken a long time to fill those boots, but we are happy to announce Artyom is now in place and curating our weekly playlists.  He is originally from Russia and moved the UK five years ago, landing in Leeds in 2013.  Artyom says "Leeds has definitely become a nice place to start my music career and with my friends I have created my major music love - a band called UNCOMELY".  He is also a promoter and owner of the www.leedscreative.uk project.  He has a passion for art, music and philosophy, so Leeds is suiting him well.  You can find him playing and hanging around his favourite places like The Belgrave Music Hall, The Brudenell Social Club, The Library or Whippingdredd Funhouse.<br /><br />If you would like to send videos for inclusion on the LMS site, email Artyom at videos [ at ] leedsmusicscene.net<br /><br />Ryan Mitchell-Smith has joined us as out CD Reviews Editor.  Ryan is a well known face on the local music scene, avid blogger with a keen interest in the local community and supporting local musicians. He says "What I love about Leeds is the people and the venues and ultimately the amazing quality of the musicians and events that relentlessly come out of the city and surrounding area. Leeds is a wonderful and supportive place full of like-minded people, and along with Wakefield has earned a place in my heart as a fantastic community that I will always try my best to serve well".  Having studied music, he can span all genres with a broad musical knowledge that enables him to remain objective no matter what lands in on his doormat.  Ryan's favourite gig to date was seeing Garbage play at The Town and Country club as it was back then on their debut album tour. "Ben Folds Five reunion gig at the O2 in Leeds was also extremely special, one of the best live performances of any band I have ever seen!" <br /><br />If you have a CD for review, Ryan is your man, get in touch by emailing cdreviews [ at ] leedsmusicscene.net.<br /><br />You can find details of all our Editorial team and contact addresses on our Contact the Team page.</p>
