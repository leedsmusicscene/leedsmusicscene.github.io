    <p>If you like discovering new music and need your Tuesday evening brightening up, I would recommend checking out the Bad Owl gig at the Fox and Newt.  They have and amazing line up of the best Post Rock you will find anywhere in the England and this gig is one you do not want to miss.<br />  <br />Kicking off the night are Ceol, math/prog-rock from Leeds, followed by post-rockers, Gilmore Trail, hailing from Sheffield.  Who have echoes of Explosions In The Sky and This Will Destroy You.  Also playing are The Program, delicious post-rock/surf-rock from Leeds, for fans of Mogwai and Pink Floyd.  You really can't dislike music like this.  <br /><br />Closing an incredible night, are the beautiful Fly on Byrd, fly on, from Sheffield, who play emotional post-rock you will fall in love with.  If you like Maybeshewill and Russian Circles, you will adore FOBFO.  I have been following the progress of these guys and was hooked on their sound from the first time I saw them play.  It was at Tramlines Festival a few years ago, in a little dingy bar off the beaten track, and they totally blew me away.  <br /><br />A guaranteed great night!<br /><br /><iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2752512898/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless>Lost Lands by Fly on Byrd, fly on.</iframe></p>
