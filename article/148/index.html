    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Untitled" recorded by Rolla. The review was written by Tony Pasquariello in 2002.</p>
    <p>Rolla, in their previous life were the band Rollerball, who won Futuresound last year and did it quite well.  So, new name new style? Well actually, no.  They like to play rock, and do it with a certain style.  They won't win any awards for originality as they stick to a tried and tested formula, but there is just something about this band that stands out.<Br><Br>From the first track <i>I Feel</i>, you could tell that this was something worthy of a big stage. "Stadium Rock" is how some would describe it.  The 2nd track, <i>Change Your World</i> is the best track on the EP. Think bands of the calibre of Counting Crows and Matchbox 20 and that is the type of sound created.  The guitars are very impressive it has to be said, and fits into the genre they are trying to create. Also the vocals are very powerful and fit greatly in the music.<Br><Br>The music they are creating might not be everyone's cup of tea, but Rolla are certain doing something right, and can only get better and better.</p>
