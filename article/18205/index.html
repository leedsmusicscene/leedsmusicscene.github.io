    <p>Organisers of the annual Live At Leeds festival have this week confirmed the first wave of bands that will be appearing at the multi-venue, all day festival in Leeds.<br /><br />Live At Leeds has established a peerless reputation for picking the most exciting new artists who are just on the cusp of great things and programming them across Leeds for one joyous musical weekend.<br /><br />More established acts complement these bright young things as they unite for three days of musical mayhem with over 150 bands performing in over 20 stages across the city.<br /><br />This year's main event takes place on Saturday 3rd May 2014 and the line-up is as strong as ever.
