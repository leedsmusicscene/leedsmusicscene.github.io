    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for Chris Selman.</p>
    <p>2011 has been an exciting and productive year for Chris and his band. They have toured nationally, playing a number of the UK's leading venues including Liverpool's O2 Academy and The Cavern Club, London's Dublin Castle, Leeds' Brudenell Social Club and Manchester's The Roadhouse, amongst others. Their headline show at the Brudenell was chosen by the BBC as their 'gig of the week' for Leeds in July.<br /><br />In July, they released their first full-band album, following Chris' solo 2010 release "Money's Everything". The new album, "All or Nothing", has been a critical and commercial success, with praise from press and radio. All five singles from the album have received BBC airplay, with "Modern Romance" being championed by Tom Robinson on his Introducing show on BBC 6 Music. Broadcasting to over a million listeners, Tom played the song, describing it as "very good music" and describing Chris as a "highly entertaining performer".<br /><br />Chris and the band are currently working on new material with a new album due in 2012.<br /><br />"Chris Selman is awesome - a great, great artist" - Alan Raw, BBC Leeds.</p>
