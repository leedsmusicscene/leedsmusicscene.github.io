    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for Deadweightless.</p>
    <p>Deadweightless are a heavy blues rock duo, based in Pontefract, West Yorkshire. After the drummer quitting & failing to find a bassist, Uncle Sam (vocals and drums) & Milky (multi-phonic guitar & backing vocals) took matters into their own hands, forming Deadweightless in early 2014. Drawing influence from the likes of Black Sabbath & Led Zeppelin, as well as more contemporary bands such as Royal Blood & The Black Keys, the end result is huge, dirty, riff heavy rock & roll.<br /> <br />After releasing 'Right Brain' early 2015, part one of a two part concept EP on the lateralization of brain function, Deadweightless are set to release part two, named 'Left Brain' late 2015/ early 2016. The band have been played on several local radio stations including BBC Introducing, have released two music videos & have gigged extensively supporting such bands as Allusondrugs, Crybabycry, Jupiter Falls & Treason Kings among many others, as well as headlining their own shows..</p>
