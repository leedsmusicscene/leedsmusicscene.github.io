    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Fruits of the Fuzz EP" recorded by Volcanoes. The review was written by Chris Audsley in 2008.</p>
    <p>If there's ever a better time to use the term 'don't judge a book by its cover' it has to be now.  When I saw the cover of the Volcanoes E.P.  I was dreading putting it on because I thought it was going to be a blast of Korn-esque nu-metal.  I couldn't have been more wrong.<br><br>The first track 'Long Live My Enemies' is very catchy.  The song is built on a smooth, clean guitar riff with a motoring rhythm.  The chorus lifts the song to the next level and the whole experience is very enjoyable.  The second track, 'Gunter the Shooter' is again really good listen and together they make a really good E.P.<br><br>With this E.P. Volcanoes have shown that they can write catchy songs and are having a fun doing it.  There are no music land marks here, but that doesn't matter when they're this enjoyable.</p>
