    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Tales From Pegasus Wood." recorded by Arthur Rigby & The Baskervylles. The review was written by Joe Scrase in 2012.</p>
    <p>I have and always will be a huge fan of all things new and inventive, however Arthur Rigby & The Baskervylles are simply too innovative to fit onto my scale of awesomeness. It's been in the last few months that I have been challenging the music in my life; I started by quitting rock and replaced it with dancehall to really challenge myself. After such success on broadening my musical horizons I decided to take it a step further and to see if I could listen to as many different genres of music in a month as possible. As such it is with great pleasure I announce my entry for what they themselves describe as a "pot of rich orchestrations, poetic lyrics, romantic melodies and powerful energy". If I didn't know better I would simply assume they were trying to justify yet another pretentious indie rock album. To assume this would be a massive oversight on my part, it is neither "indie" nor "pretentious", it is however a beautifully crafted piece of awesomeness.<br /><br />On the press release sent to me, the EP is said to be a pivotal piece on which all the band are tied together by "moving from the huge chorus of Dark Clouds to the epic climatic storm on Lead single One Stormy Night". Personally, I don't see it; I do however see what is meant by "the huge success of the band in 2011". To play Reading, Leeds and Deer Shed Festival when they have only been together a short time is a mighty achievement. <br /><br />The 5 track EP manages to cover all sorts of topics and genres, from the stormy 'One Stormy Night' to the multi layered 'Dark Clouds'.  <br /><br />Is anyone else sensing the semantic field of storms? After all, the band has certainly been creating a storm in the Yorkshire music scene after being chosen for BBC Introducing in West Yorkshire.<br /><br />I wish the band all the best for 2012, not that you need it when you have music as strong as this! <br /><br />'One Stormy Night' is available for free from from <a href="http://arthurrigby.bandcamp.com">arthurrigby.bandcamp.com</a>.</p>
