        <h1>d-koy - Temperature</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Temperature" recorded by d-koy. The review was written by Sam Saunders in 2004.</p>
    <p>Seb Greenfield sings and plays guitar, Sam Hyman plays bass and the American Vic Pavon does for drumming.<br><br>Bradford's D-koy are a very serious band who bank a lot on the sharpness of their technical skill. The three tracks are presented as "recorded live" and yes, they are exceptionally well made. The general approach is fierce control - making the classic prog-rock three piece sound like some kind of urban-aware hip-hop cool technoids with electronic metronome implants. They do it with minimal FX and maximum mastery of what voice, guitars and drums can do. There are shreds of Frank Zappa at his most demanding and the likes of King Crimson in their inaccessible moments. If this doesn’t sound completely 2004, then that's probably about right. Guitar rock has been hurtling outwards and apart since the early 70's - like some kind of exploding universe where the stars get dimmer and further away from each other with every passing nanosecond. No reviewer and no musician can know what the full picture looks like, and innovations disappear and recur as fast as 16 to the bar slap bass. Is this brand new post-industrial emo wizardry, or rehashed 1980s post-punk jazz-funk? The Constantines or Level 42? It's both, I guess.<br><br>I'm trying hard here to let you know that this band have something a bit special, without putting them into a stupid category that trashes the immediacy and excitement of what they're up to. I can hear Sting and Dark Star inflexions - but that's my personal listening past working. If you go to their next gig with an open-mind and no rules their stuff could easily grip your follicles and smack you against a wall of disbelief and amazement. It’s going to depend a lot on what the venue is, who you’re with and who else is on the bill. Many fashion-slaves with low self-confidence are going to rule D-koy out of consideration right from the start - they fail to offend in the currently approved ways, and they take a chance on being appreciated entirely on the strength of their densely-packed music. Pretty unforgivable, I guess.</p>
