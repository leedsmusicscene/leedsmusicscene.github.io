    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for The Coopers.</p>
    <p>Happy folk sung by happy folk, with a twist of pop thrown in for good measure.The Coopers came to life when two breezy Aussies packed up in search of new sounds, picking up an Englishman and a Greek along the way. Having only crossed paths little over a year ago, The Coopers have already been making significant headway with their track 'Ripples' recently being selected for E4's teen-hit UK comedy 'The Inbetweeners'. They have also showcased their work live, as feature artists on BBC Introducing. <br /><br />Their eagerly-awaited debut EP is set for release early 2011. It promises to be an authentic reflection of their live performances - full of energy, unexpected arrangements and a healthy dose of good ol' fashioned gumption! Produced by Peak Studios (in the UK and US), and mastered by Streaky Mastering (Lilly Allen, The White Stripes, Snow Patrol), these are get-up-and-go songs about love worth holding onto, life worth chasing and keeping it simple. Adopting a motley toy box of instruments ranging from a polystyerene chipbox to a rainbow family of ceramic bells, the Cooper's will never fail to leave you feeling like they've lightened your load..</p>
