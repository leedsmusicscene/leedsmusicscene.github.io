        <h1>Post War Glamour Girls release 'Tragic Loss; He Had Such a Lovely House'</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2012.</p>
    <p>Following the news this week that Post War Glamour Girls are to play the NME / Radio One Stage at the Reading and Leeds Festivals, the band have announced details of a new single that will be released on Monday, 6th August.<br /><br />Titled 'Tragic Loss; He Had Such a Lovely House' the EP is an ambitious 4-part song cycle that well and truly delivers on the promise shown by the morsels PWGG tossed out last year. <br /><br />The record's sonic attributes are a true indicator of the band's relentless work ethic and desire for complete creative control. 'Tragic Loss' was self-produced by the band in a freezing cold warehouse by the railway tracks in Leeds over several bleak December weeks, using pooled resources and borrowed microphones.<br /><br />The songs brood, bruise and blaze, recalling everything from the moody eclecticism of Modest Mouse to Nick Cave at his most visceral (the utterly berserk 'Today I Am a Man'), to the immovable, self-possessed twang of Richard Hawley, and even early Queen at their most furiously torrid. At the same time, they remain absolutely singular.<br /><br />'Tragic Loss; He Had Such a Lovely House' will be released on Monday 6th August as a strictly limited run of 250 x 10" singles (including free digital download). There will also be an equally limited run of CDs, and you can get the tracks via the usual digital outlets - iTunes, 7Digital, Spotify and the rest.</p>
