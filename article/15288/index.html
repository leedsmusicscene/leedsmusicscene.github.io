        <h1>Down The Machine - Know Your Place</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Know Your Place" recorded by Down The Machine. The review was written by Matt Benatan in 2011.</p>
    <p>Down The Machine have recently been making quite an impact on the local scene. Their bass player, Neil Short (or perhaps more commonly known as Shortie), recently organised Leeds' first Metal Fringe - a metal and alternative rock contribution to the already established Leeds Festival Fringe. Along with this, the boys have played an acoustic set in Harvey Nicholls (no, that one didn't quite make sense to me either), been played on Total Rock and, most recently, are gearing up to release their new single 'Know Your Place'.<br /><br />So, onto the music. 'Know Your Place' is a monster of a track; effortlessly holding your attention through the sweepingly atmospheric and melodically rich verses, while slowly building your anticipation for the suitably huge and anthemic chorus. The track is somewhat reminiscent of what may happen if Pearl Jam and Nine Inch Nails were to get together, mate (in a musical sense, of course), and produce a track in the vein of NIN's 'We're In This Together'; flawlessly combining Eddie Vedder's vocal depth with Reznor's textural craftsmanship. All in all, if you're a fan of 90's alternative rock, then you're guaranteed to love Down The Machine.<br /><br />These boys certainly know their place when it comes to song writing, and if this is a taste of what's to come, then people are sure to be queuing out of Harvey Nic's (or actual venues, if you can't wait for another acoustic set), anxiously awaiting their future musical offerings. The single's out on Ambicon Records on October 10th, until then you can keep up with the boys via www.downthemachine.com.</p>
