    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2015.</p>
    <p>Earlier this week the organisers of Live At Leeds - which is now celebrating its tenth anniversary - revealed the first wave of bands that will be appearing at the annual festival in 2016.<br /><br />The first bands included Jess Glynne, Circa Waves, We Are Scientists, Band of Skulls, Rat Boy, Clean Cut Kid and Barns Courtney.<br /> <br />Speaking about this year's talent and the festival's 10 year legacy, lead booker Andy Smith commented:<br /><br />"2016 will be the tenth year of booking Live at Leeds, it feels like a great achievement to have grown what was originally a four venue bill to what it is today. <br /><br />We have seen some great names grace our stages over those ten years and I'm really looking forward to next year and what will hopefully be our biggest event yet, it really feels like we are stepping up another level."<br /> <br />Live At Leeds 2016 takes place across multiple venues around Leeds on Saturday 30th April 2016. Early Bird tickets for the event have now sold out. Until the end of the year, tickets will be available at the next tier level (Â£30) via Leeds Gig tickets.</p>
