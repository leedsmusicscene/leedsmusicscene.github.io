    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2015.</p>
    <p>Organisers of the Leeds Festival 2016 yesterday announced their first headliner for August 2016. <br /><br />Taking to the Main Stage for what promises to be a phenomenal headline will be Red Hot Chili Peppers. It's nine years since their last performance and it's fair to say their live return is highly anticipated.<br /><br />Melvin Benn commented, "I'm thrilled to be able to announce Red Hot Chili Peppers as the first headliner for Reading & Leeds 2016, as a festival exclusive. Their incredible live show will be an unforgettable headline performance at the UK's biggest music festival. We've still got some really exciting names to announce and I can't wait to reveal the rest of the line up. It's going to be our best year yet."<br /><br />Other bands confirmed for Leeds 2016 were The 1975, Courteeners, Twenty One Pilots, Slaves, Hinds, Rat Boy, Crossfaith, and DJ EZ.<br /><br />Details of weekend ticket prices for Leeds 2016 were also confirmed. Weekend tickets are Â£205 and you can also pay via the instalment plan - tickets for Leeds Festival 2016 can be purchased now.</p>
