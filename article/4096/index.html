    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for Otherside.</p>
    <p>In 2005 Danny Cope (Lead Guitar) created otherside with John Paul Giles (Bass), Phill Clarke (Vocals & Guitar) and Chris Mitton (Drums)<br /><br />With a collection of cover songs ranging from the original indie bands Happy Mondays & Stone Roses, to more recent rock legends Oasis & Stereophonics, otherside agreed to play at The Roundhay Pub in Leeds with a massive set list of 30 songs. With it being a local pub, for the lads and their first ever gig, it was always guaranteed to be a big success.<br /><br />The night created a thirst for more....<br /><br />Since then otherside dropped the covers and started writing new original material and have supported Leeds legends "The Bridewell Taxis" at Leeds University stylus bar, sold out tickets on several occasions for The Cockpit in Leeds and played to a massive crowd at The Cavern in Liverpool. In 2007 otherside recorded their first official studio EP "This is the first" with Andy Walton on drums. The CD got a fantastic review from Kim Etheridge <br />For www.manchesterismusic.co.uk and promoted the new CD for Live at Leeds event. At the end of 2007 Mark Shilton was then introduced as the bands new drummer. Mark found his feet within just a few rehearsals, so the band quickly booked & played another record sell-out at The Cockpit.<br /><br />Although preferring not to pigeon hole themselves otherside are best described as "anthemic/melodic/indie/pop rock". "Each song has something different to offer, a different hook to draw you in" Jackie Hitchen BBc<br /><br />There is a great buzz around Leeds at the moment and otherside are smack bang in the middle of it, so "before you have to pay £30 for a cramped view, you would do well to keep an eye on The Otherside" Jo Pearson BBc.</p>
