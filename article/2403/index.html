        <h1>Daghdha - Start of the Mile</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Start of the Mile" recorded by Daghdha. The review was written by Lewis Denby in 2004.</p>
    <p>This band will be big.<br><br>When trawling through the thriving yet generally unimaginative Leeds scene, dominated as it is by generic pop-punk and the occasional 'innovative' ska movement, it's a relief to chance upon something a bit different.  Daghdha, a young and upcoming Irish-influenced five-piece, are definitely that: despite being clearly inspired by a variety of previous bands, the blend of musical styles is something very rarely heard in the music underground today.<br><br>Debut release Start of the Mile, recorded and released by the band itself, is a fairly short album, at only six tracks and less than twenty minutes play time.  Still, it's a clear indication of things to come.  Daghdha label their style as 'folk-punk'; a more accurate description would probably be 'aggressive folk-rock'.  The strong punk influences don't really stem far past their inventive cover of The Clash's famous London Calling, but some subtle undertones do flow throughout.<br><br>Daghdha's speciality, as demonstrated by Start of the Mile, is taking existing songs and putting their own twist on them - indeed, the vast majority of the record comprises covers of one form or another.  Track two is a faithful homage to The Clash: London Calling keeps its unique feel, but is effectively 'Daghdhified' by Simon Barr's excellent violin lead.  Half way through the CD, a gorgeous rendition of Waltzing Matilda kicks in; anyone that doesn't find themselves screaming "Waltzing Matilda, WALTZING MATILDA" at the top of their voice after listening must have some sort of problem.  It's sublime.<br><br>The individual musicians are clearly talented, with some decent work from each and every band member at some point, but Daghdha are more about the overall sound.  It's reminiscent of a kind of heavier Pogues, with grizzly, distorted guitars making way for cheerful jig-esque violin work.  It's not a particularly varied recording, but the consistent style is more than a little unique.<br><br>Start of the Mile is true to its name in a number of ways.  It's not <i>technically</i> the best album ever.  Some of the levels seem a little dubious, and at times you begin to wonder whether Tom King's vocals really <i>are</i> meant to have a 'folk charm', or whether he just isn't a very good singer.  Moreover, some tracks don't have much of a structure, and revolve around the standard verse-chorus-verse-chorus format.<br><br>However, if there's one thing to take from this charming EP, it's that this really is the start of the mile for Daghdha.  In such tedious times, a breath of fresh air like this is certain to do well.  Watch out for this lot.  You'll be seeing more of them.</p>
