    <p>Bright Light Syndrome, a 5-piece alternative rock band from Leeds, are releasing their debut EP 'Innocence Is Bliss' on Monday 30th April. <br /><br />To celebrate the release, the band is holding a launch party at the 360 Club, upstairs at The Library, on Friday 27th.<br /><br />'Innocence Is Bliss' will be available for download from the Bright Light Syndrome website from 7pm on Monday 30th April. <br /><br />At the gig on the night of the 360 Club launch party, fans will be able to buy exclusive CD copies of the 4 track EP, featuring some fantastic artwork and a bonus track that is not included in the digital release.<br /><br />With over 400 downloads of their debut single 'Nowhere', which Supajam (organizers of Strawberry Fields, Benicassim, Hop Farm) described as 'epic', Bright Light Syndrome have already gained recognition, including on Tom Robinson's Listening Post (BBC Radio 6) and with Alan Raw on BBC Introducing. <br /><br />In his review of 'Innocence Is Bliss', Steve Tay of A Musical Priority online magazine wrote "'Nowhere' is a real moment of pop genius... a tune that is made for day time radio" and describes the EP as "overflowing with songs full of soaring guitars, powerful vocals and pop melodies". <br /><br />Bright Light Syndrome play 360 Club Friday 27th April with support from The Arrogance of King Canute, Tsar Nicholas III & the Exiles, and Return to Aljustrel. <br /><br />Doors open at 8pm and advance tickets cost just Â£4 from Jumbo Records.</p>
