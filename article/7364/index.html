    <p>Leeds’ hottest new bands and musicians are again being given the opportunity to shine in the annual Bright Young Things project. Organised by Leeds City Council, and now into its 12th year, BYT 2007 will offer eager local musicians (under the age of 25) the chance to follow in the footsteps of Mobo award winner and former participant Corinne Bailey Rae.<br><br>Fifteen groups or solo artists will be selected by music experts to work in a recording studio and feature on a unique BYT showcase CD. Set for release in March 2007, copies of the CD will be distributed through local magazine the Leeds Guide as well as being sent to influential music industry insiders and media contacts around the country.<br><br>As well as the free recording time, all of the chosen bands and musicians will receive a free photoshoot; website, press and media coverage; and will take part in a series of live gigs around the city.<br><br>John Procter (Leeds City Council) said, “Bright Young Things is now firmly established as a great way for the music stars of tomorrow to start out on the road to success. The standard continues to get better and better every year and anyone thinking of taking part needs to only take a look at the success of Corinne Bailey Rae to see what they can achieve by getting involved. It really could be the start of something big.”<br><br>All bands needs to do to enter is get together a demo of original work, as well as a biography and a couple of photos, then send it in along with an application form.<br><br>Those interested can get full details and downloadable application forms from the website: www.leeds.gov.uk/byt.<br><br>The deadline for applications is Friday 17th November and recording will commence during December and January.</p>
