    <p>Cloth Cat continues to run a series of exciting free courses based around music in association with the Workers Education Association, for people in the Woodhouse & Hyde Park ward of Leeds. This is the ideal opportunity for people to get involved whether they want to develop their skills to find work in the music industry, meet others interested in music whilst doing something creative and fun. Courses on offer include “Let Us Gig: stagecraft and an intro to live performance”; The Music Business; Music Technology; and “DIY Record Label: set up your own record label in 5 easy steps”<br><Br>The project works with experienced tutors including Si Denbigh who has over 20 years of experience in many aspects of the music business having released loads of records, formed and fronted bands, touring and performing all over the world. As well as having been signed to various major labels, management and publishing companies he has set up and run his own record labels and has just created a new mainly Internet based record label to release material by himself and other artists.  Amongst other things he is currently playing sequencers/computers/keyboards with a well known band from Leeds.<br><Br>Cloth Cat now offers a new 10 week course entitled “the music business: how it works, how to get a job in it and how to survive as a musician”. Tutor Stewart Coxhead  has a vast wealth of experience in his field having worked as General Manager of PolyGram, run Bullet, an independent promotion company during the 1980s and since the 90’s he ran Art and Music, a highly successful international artist management organisation. To cap it all, he co-owns one of the most successful British Dance labels of recent times, AATW.<br><Br>Mike Jolly, Cloth Cat Development Worker, said: “We’ve been really lucky to find tutors who’ve really been there and done it and want to pass their knowledge on to others in the area. We’ve found that many people wanting to get in to music feel like they are working in a vacuum, so we are sure they will get new ideas and information whilst getting a really positive experience from these courses”<br><Br>All courses are FREE and begin in the week starting Monday 10th January 2005. They are based at The Cardigan Centre on Cardigan Road in Burley and at The Primrose Pub on Meanwood Road.<br><Br>For more information and to book your place, visit www.clothcatleeds.org.uk.
