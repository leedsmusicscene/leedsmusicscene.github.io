    <p>During the Boxing Day floods, Tramp/The Treated were amongst the casualties at Blueberry Hill Studios with some vintage Sunn speakers in critical condition. To try and raise funds to restore these, many Leeds bands who have played our Tramp night contributed songs to a compilation we're selling. <br /><br />As well as having great songs by the likes of Eagulls, Autobahn, NARCS, Silverlode, Hilary and the Hate Crimes and Pink Rick, it also contains beautiful previously unreleased tracks from Leeds' Deadwall and Das Pain respectively. <br /><br />It's worth the five quid for those songs alone! Although a small percentage is going towards speaker restoration, the majority of any funds raised will be donated to the Calder Valley Flood Appeal.<br /><br />Buy the CD at bandcamp.<br /><br />The official launch is at Hebden Bridge Trades Club on 18th March. Playing on the night are Snack Family, The Pink Diamond Revue and Deadwall with the excellent White Rabbit DJs. If you've not been before, have a venture out to this beautiful venue and show some love!</p>
