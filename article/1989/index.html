    <p>Leeds based four-piece, The Breech, were formed in July 2001 and have developed a deeply musical and distinctly unique sound.  They draw on a broad range of musical influences, blending guitars, synthesizer and piano, coupled with subtle vocal harmony and powerful yet beautiful melody.  The bands material is original and quirky, bringing about a passionate energy that has entertained audiences throughout the country.<br><br>September 2004 saw The Breech top the Pulse Radio Unsigned chart, having over 80,000 votes cast over a two-month period.  Throughout a busy year the band honed their live performance with a number of high profile gigs, including support slots with Ian McCulloch, Ian McNabb and Stephen Fretwell, each time building upon their national fan base. The band has also enjoyed success in London with energetic and exceptional performances at a number of venues, receiving critical acclaim along the way.<br><br>The legendary Parr Street studios, Liverpool, was the setting for a pre-production session prior to collaborating with producer and engineer John Spence (The Beautiful South, The Paddingtons), crafting a collection of inspiring and exceptional tracks, which the band regard as their finest work to date.<br><br>The Breech are now a respected and professional act, attracting a broad range of record label interest..</p>
