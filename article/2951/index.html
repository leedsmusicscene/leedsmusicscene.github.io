    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for Vatican Jet.</p>
    <p>Vatican Jet are an indie rock four-piece from Leeds. Since moving to the city, they have worked their way to the top alongside the best bands of the current exciting scene. To all who have witnessed the band’s ascent, Vatican Jet is now synonymous with contagious good tunes and memorable good times.<br><br>On record, they are developing a dynamic rock-pop recipe, flavoured by the likes of riff-heavy predecessors Pixies, Led Zeppelin and Television, whilst maintaining the indie pop sensibilities of Beatles and Super Furry Animals, and completed with a touch of The Coral-esque rockabilly thrown in for good measure.<br><br>Live, having played with other local contemporaries The Sunshine Underground, This Et Al, and Forward Russia, as well as tour support for bands such as Editors and Tramp Attack, the band bring a confident, personal and charismatic show to every venue, be it the basement parties and bedrooms of Leeds 6 or the pubs, clubs or festivals of the world beyond.<br><br>During 2005 the band have catalogued their progress, locally recording and releasing four cunningly colour-coded demos (‘Red, ‘Yellow’, ‘Green’ and the new ‘Bronze’!) and have successfully completed two 20 odd gig national tours.<br><br>In October 2005, the last track on the enclosed green demo, ‘Plan B’, was re-recorded and released on 7” record by new indie label, Engine Room Records and within 3 weeks of release, had sold out of all 300 copies.  And second national tour was being embarked on in October and November 2005 to help promote this debut single. The band also recently performed a live session for BBC Raw Talent, a weekly show broadcast to the whole of Yorkshire and Humberside..</p>
