    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2013.</p>
    <p>Over a thousand music fans flocked to Wakefield this weekend for the sold out Long Division Festival (read our review).<br /><br />The festival, in its third year, sold out on the Saturday with over a thousand people attending across seven stages to watch over 70 bands.<br /><br />The sunshine added to an action packed weekend, which saw legendary Manchester group The Fall headline Warehouse 23 on Saturday night. There was also a warm up event on Friday night at the old Drury Lane library, which was transformed into a musical hub for the weekend.<br /><br />Dean Freeman, organiser of Long Division Festival said: "This year's Long Division Festival was our most successful yet - in terms of how many people came to Wakefield, the feedback we have received and the quality and diversity of the performers we put on. We are thrilled that the festival once again sold out, just as it did in 2011."<br /><br />The Saturday saw over 1,500 people in Wakefield City Centre, which was a sell-out attendance. Feedback from attendees has praised the attention to detail and friendly, positive atmosphere as well as the amount of great stuff we squashed into the schedule. <br /><br />Dean added, "I personally feel so proud with this year's festival. We stuck to our principals and ethics and showed that Wakefield can be an exciting and positive place to be. It was a massive effort by a very small team, but we were supported by all kinds of people who strongly believe in the city and its music and culture. More than anything, I think the success of Long Division this year proves the strength of the DIY community in the city. We can't wait for next year."<br /><br />This year's festival has been the biggest in its three year history with many ticket holders travelling from outside the city. It also received funding from JD Roots, The Co-Operative and the Arts Council.<br /><br />A retrospective evening in July will also be taking place with screenings of the films made over the weekend, fan footage and exclusive band sessions.</p>
