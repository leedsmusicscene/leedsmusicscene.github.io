    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2007.</p>
    <p>With over 150 bands already set to appear at the Carling Weekend: Leeds Festival 2007, organisers have today announced the debut of a new stage.<br><br>The Alternative Stage will feature unique musical and multi media collaborations, top name comedy and cabaret and audience Q&As.<br><br>Leeds gets a special treat by starting a day early on the Thursday evening with a very special production called 'Dream Of An Opium Eater'.  A unique collaboration featuring Ben Calvert from Killing Joke, Ivar S. Peersen from Enslaved, Reuben Gotto from Twin Zero / Johnny Truant and Julia Ruzicka from Million Dead, the quartet will revise the old silent movie tradition of a pianist accompanying films, by improvising a soundtrack of intense metal to accompany horror shorts.<br><br>Also on the Thursday is a very rare showing for cult classic ‘American Hardcore’. The film that documents the US underground punk scene from 1980 to 1986 and features the legends that are Black Flag, Bad Brains, The Replacements and a host of others has never gained a general release in the UK and any serious fan of US alternative music will find the film both fascinating and enthralling.<br><br>Finally, on the Thursday, Youthmovie Soundtrack Strategies will visit their hardcore roots to perform a set alongside Minor Threat live video footage from 1982.<br><br>Transgressive Records visit Leeds on the Friday, showcasing audio visual sets from their roster, including the much tipped Battle and Jeremy Warmsley alongside Absentee, 3 Trapped Tigers, Noah And The Whale, Beans On Toast, Lucy And The Caterpillar and Mechnical Bride.<br><br>Comedy retains its special place on the stage during the day with headline sets from Simon Amstell, Ed Byrne and Tim Minchin.</p>
