    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2011.</p>
    <p>The B-Side Project is a remix competition that is running in 10 cities across 5 countries. The Leeds Project launched in January 2011 and the organisers are on the search for Leeds musicians to take part.<br /><br />If you are a solo artist, in a band or are an electronic producer then you have the opportunity through the B-Side Project to collaborate with other artists to create the ultimate remix.<br /><br />Across the cities the B-Side Project involves 600 artists and the aim of the project is to encourage the creative juices of local artists (that's YOU) whilst providing them with means of promotion, a platform to have their tracks heard, and be in with a chance of being released.  <br /><br />There are 60 places available for Leeds musicians: 30 for live artists and 30 for electronic artists. Applications will be accepted until 28th January 2011, after which each chosen live artist will be paired with an electronic artist to work together on their remix.<br /><br />Ten remixes will be chosen from the submissions to be released as an album. Announcements of the 10 winning remixes, plus performances by various artists involved, will be held at Eiger Studios in Leeds on Friday 1st April. <br /><br />The album launch event is scheduled for Wednesday 20th April, also at Eiger.<br /><br />In promoting the project the organisers said, "Remixes are a fantastic opportunity for both live artist and producer to really get creative and do something new. The B-Side Project is a fantastic opportunity for artists to do this, plus benefit from free promotion, valuable contacts, and the chance to have their remix released."<br /> <br />For more details, including the terms and conditions of entry, visit www.b-sideproject.org/leeds.</p>
