    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for The Final Sigh.</p>
    <p>Formed in 2003, The Final Sigh have taken massive steps in the underground and mainstream music channels. From self financed EP releases to major exposure which includes splits with Corpo's RSJ, stateside publication with Rotting Corpse Records' Raw Aggression compilation and maintaining a presence on Chicago's Metalworks Radio. This was followed up with the critically acclaimed debut album "If You're Not Part of the Solution, You're Part of the Problem" released worldwide in May 2005 through Anticulture Records. During this time the band gained further exposure including a Metal Hammer profile of the band and a number of Radio appearances including Total Rock and 4Q Radio. <br /><br />After numerous tours, including Horse The Band's "Mechanical Hand" tour, it became clear the band was growing tired of the material they had been playing for three years and a new<br /> direction was required. <br /><br />After several changes to the line up and a long writing periods, The Final Sigh found a stable platform to build on and their sophomore album began to take shape. However the pressure of writing and recording became too much for one of the newer members and during the final days of tracking The Final Sigh lost their vocalist. After a lot of searching the band finally found the missing link between style and substance in the vocal talent of Kyle Spooner. Bringing in the new vocalist and, subsequently new bass player Peter Scott, added the stability the band had lacked. The dust was brushed off album number two and it was given a name; <br />'Canada'.<br /><br />Where most bands will pigeon-hole themselves into a genre, The Final Sigh have always made classification near impossible with carefully crafted material that flows seamlessly between diving riffs and relaxed melody, whilst being able to crack eardrums in the same bar as subtle layered ambient breaks. Unconcerned by the traditional expectations of what a "metal" band should be, the band continue to push themselves whilst maintaining a ferocious and atmospheric live <br />performance.<br /><br />Taking a break from writing and recording process The Final Sigh released the EP 'Prologue' (Joseki records) as a five track taste of what to expect from 'Canada' on the 19th of July 2010. <br /><br />Despite clocking up some serious time in the studio and with some significant periods of forced downtime in the past, The Final Sigh are no strangers to the live circuit. With multiple UK tours behind them band has also shared a stage with, Bring Me The Horizon, Cephalic Carnage, Caliban, Enter Shikari, Red Sparowes, Chickenhawk, and Devil Sold His Soul.<br /> <br />The EP 'Prologue' is available through iTunes, Napster, Tesco Digital, iLike, eMusic and all good digital music outlets.<br /><br />The Release of 'Prologue' on the 19th of July 2010 marks the beginning of a very new journey... from Leeds to 'Canada'....</p>
