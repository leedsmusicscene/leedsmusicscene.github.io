    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Sloppiness Counts" recorded by The 42 Tones. The review was written by Dave Sugden in 2001.</p>
    <p>Ska.  There's something about Leeds and ska music.  The 42 Tones sit nicely right in the middle of that genre, and from all accounts these are a very young seven-piece band doing quite well for themselves.  Opening their CD with a very pertinent line, "The scene don't suck, So stop you're moaning, The scene don't suck, So shut up", this is a band who are trying to establish themselves on the local music circuit - and I see no problems with them doing this.<Br><Br>The talent is there.  The musicianship is there and there's a nice, happy bouncy feel to the music, which I've learnt is so typical of this genre.  I like the backing vocals and I also like the way that there are distinct moments of singing.  It makes what The 42 Tones do stand out slightly from others I've heard locally.<Br><br>What it does lack however, is something that I want to shout out about - there's nothing really that I feel I'm going to remember come next week, which is a shame.<Br><Br>There's a moment in "Summer Song" that kicks off a bit, and this is something that I feel they do well and should emphasise and put energy into.  This song also showcases their young adolescent lyrics: "I like summer smoking bongs, I like girls in tiny thongs, I hope you like our summer song".  In answer to their question - I do.<br><br>If you like to dance at your gigs, check these guys out.  You'll have a great time.  "Feel Da Funk" - Yeah.</p>
