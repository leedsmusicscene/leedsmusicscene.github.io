        <h1>The Wednesday Club - Katapult</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Katapult" recorded by The Wednesday Club. The review was written by Kathryn Holden in 2010.</p>
    <p>This afternoon I have been baking banana bread and avoiding doing dissertation research. Why on earth is this relevant? Well, because the soundtrack to my afternoon of playing around in the kitchen and getting flour all over me has been The Wednesday Club's charmingly kiddish, indie-poptastic treat, 'Katapult.'<br /><br />Let's extend this scene into a ridiculous metaphor: The Wednesday Club are like a big slab of banana cake: you know that it's not the best thing for you, it's far too sweet at times and probably a bit gooey and undercooked, but, you indulge anyway, and if anything, after the first few bites, you can't get enough and before you know it you've eaten a whole loaf.  Ok, so this imagery may not be as particularly illustrative as I might have liked, but the point is, this afternoon, I really grew to love The Wednesday Club's soft and simple, no-frills beach-surf doo-wap guitar-pop brand of rock and roll. <br /><br />'Katapult' has this lovely Buddy Holly-esque straightforwardness about it. 'Trust Thing' sets the tone for the rest of the record, unashamedly happy, upbeat, short, sharp and to the point. Songs average at about two minutes long on this album: they're just little snapshots of niceness. 'Wave at Planes' is a heart warming ditty about just being completely crap at life. As are a lot of the songs actually. Maybe this a key theme of the album: that a lot of the time we're all completely crap in our own little way, and we may as well make fun out of this or we'll all be thoroughly depressed. <br /><br />The Wednesday Club aren't trying to present anything epic here, they're just doing what they love in the hope that you listen to it while doing something that you love, and whether or not that's pulverising bananas into butter and sugar, then so be it! It's the shared experience that counts. As brooding-teenager Dwain says in Little Miss Sunshine: "do what you love and fuck the rest," a sentiment very much echoed in 'Katapult's final song, 'Citalogasm,' in which "fuck the world, fuck the whole wide world" excellently reins out as the main chorus, message and spirit of the whole album. Three cheers for The Wednesday Club. 'Katapult' is a triumph in simply doing what you like and having fun in the process.</p>
