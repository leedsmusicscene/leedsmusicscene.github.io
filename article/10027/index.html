        <h1>ChasinJade - Untitled</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Untitled" recorded by ChasinJade. The review was written by Jessica Thornsby in 2008.</p>
    <p>This demo from Leeds based “groove-metallers” ChasinJade kicks off with ‘Kiss The World Goodbye.’ This track features an impressive high of pounding drums, raw, live-sounding riffs and screamo vocals, proving right from the start that ChasinJade can deliver the goods when it comes to professional-sounding metalcore. However, although the rest of ‘Kiss The World Goodbye’ does feature some nicely gritty chords and the occasional big riff, for the most part it’s a veneer of paint-by-numbers indie guitars that’ll leave you wishing that the whole of ‘Kiss The World Goodbye’ matched up to its more metallic moments.<br><br>The other major problem with ‘Kiss The World Goodbye’ is that, although Charlie Robinson certainly has the voice to front a band, ChasinJade keep his vocals at the forefront of the entire song. It quickly becomes clear that Robinson’s isn’t one of those rare voices that can withstand close scrutiny. Thrusting his voice at the listener in this way is completely unnecessary, especially since he sounds a hundred times better when backed by a wall of riffs on second track ‘Not In My Name.’<br><br>Interestingly, Robinson adopts a deeper vocal style for this song than he does in ‘Kiss The World Goodbye.’ Occasionally, he seems to be straining to reach those low notes, but for the most part this vocal style perfectly complements the song’s classic-sounding riffs. ChasinJade seem to have a far greater talent for heavier music, than they do for the thin rock of ‘Kiss The World Goodbye.’<br><br>‘Not In My Name’ also has a great chorus, bulked up with some old school rock and roll riffs, and a bridge section crammed with stormy-sounding chords.<br><br>However, there are still some misjudgements: ChasinJade insist on cracking out the acoustic guitars for the verses and indulge in questionable lyrics and some horrendous mock free-styling vocals, but that heavy, hoarse-throated chorus does more than enough to redeem ‘Not In My Name.’<br><br>‘Suffocate’ is this demo’s stand-out track, being easily heavier and more developed than the other three. Even Robinson sounds like a more grown-up and competent vocalist when backed by chugging riffs, a catchy-but-crushing metalcore chorus, and the occasional squealing chord acting as an immediate hook into all the heaviness.<br><br>The verses may be less developed and veer towards ‘Kiss The World Goodbye’ territory, but ‘Suffocate’ is still a mind-bogglingly massive improvement on the previous two songs, which makes you wonder whether this is the only brand new song on this demo, and the other three are slightly older works.<br><br>‘Euthanasia’ sees ChasinJade edge away from metal, with verses full of plodding drums and subdued guitars, and those too-prominent vocals. Thankfully, they break out the big, metal-tinged riffs for the chorus and end-section, giving Robinson the necessary padding he needs when he’s reaching for those big notes.<br><br>But, the essential mistake ‘Euthanasia’ makes is one that pretty much sums up this entire recording: whenever ChasinJade take it down a notch, they become flat and uninteresting, but the moment they go for the listener’s throat, everything falls into place. If in the future ChasinJade can always sound as ferocious as they sometimes do on this demo, then they will really be an up-and-coming metalcore band to watch out for.</p>
