    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2004.</p>
    <p>The Scaramanga Six are to release a new single in advance of the full commercial release of their Cabin Fever album. The track is called We Rode The Storm and is a musical testament to the band’s "never stop playing even when close friends plead with you to stop" attitude.<br><br>The song is from the recent sessions with Cardiacs man Tim Smith and will also feature three B-sides and a video of the title track.<br><bR>The other songs include "Pincers", "Director's Cut" and "The Story Of The Six".<br><bR>The Scaramanga Six describe the background to the new single: "Imagine you've just been to a big rock festival and you’ve seen lots of new bands who seem to getting a lot of popularity only to find that they are the exact soundalike of XTC, only nowhere near as good. Then go over to a friend’s house where they are listening to something they downloaded of a new band that sounds exactly like a watered down Talking Heads and you say to them "This sounds like a watered down Talking Heads" and they say "Who are Talking Heads?" Imagine the daily disappointment of such things - you’ll be getting somewhere near the motivation for this song and indeed the reason why The Scaramanga Six are still peddling their own brand of pop in the face of all of this tripe. Because all of this simply fuels them on."<BR><br>The single is scheduled for release on Monday, 8th November on the Wrath Records label.</p>
