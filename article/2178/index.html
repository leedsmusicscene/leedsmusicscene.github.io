"Whilst nowadays it may be de rigeur for a budding musician to stay firmly within the confines of their bedroom, Paul honed his craft in the more traditional manner – in front of an audience. Whilst the bedroom keeps drunken hecklers at bay there is no such respite on stage. It is for this reason that every note counts and every utterance means something to him. Not content to create music to idly kill spare time, as others might, Paul creates something that should stand the test of time more readily than those who lack such passion. There’s no doubt that we are in an age where a barrage of singer songwriter drivel has been driving us all insane with it's catchy, but instantly forgettable melodies, perhaps this is the breath of fresh air we have all been waiting for. Someone who offers us something to remember.".</p>
