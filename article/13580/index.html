        <h1>The Who release 40th anniversary collectors' edition of 'Live At Leeds' on November 15th</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2010.</p>
    <p>The Who will release a special 40th anniversary edition of 'Live At Leeds' on November 15th 2010.<br /><br />Following on the heels of the success of the 'rock opera' Tommy, and the band's grandstanding appearance at the Woodstock Festival, when released in 1970, 'Live At Leeds' unwittingly documented The Who at the peak of their powers, whose shows now stretched up to two and a half hours without a break containing Tommy as their centrepiece.<br /><br />Except it should have been very different... the original intention was to release the recording from the Hull City Hall performance the following night after Leeds as the live album. The recording from Leeds, the first gig of the tour, was largely set up as a back-up in case there were any problems with the Hull recording. <br /><br />"Hull was a better gig than Leeds," recalls Roger Daltrey. "I remember it like it was yesterday, although in retrospect 'Live At Hull' doesn't really trip off the tongue!"<br /><br />This new edition of one of the most important live rock albums ever contains two CDs containing the full Leeds show from 14 February 1970, and, for the first time ever, two CDs containing The Who's complete performance from Hull.</p>
