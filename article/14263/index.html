    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for Quiet Rebellion.</p>
    <p>Quiet Rebellion is the brainchild, and dramatic musical project of Award winning Leeds based songwriter Shaun T Hunter.<br /><br />Having followed the tried, and tested route of learning songs by his favourite artists on guitar at an early age, Shaun progressed through the Indie band scene of the 90's, before taking the brave step of going solo in the 2000's, and releasing a series of highly acclaimed and unique albums.<br /><br />Now, in the form of 'Still Talking Scribble' Shaun has released his most honest work to date as it takes us on a journey from the darkest corners of the mind, to the deepest recesses of the soul.<br /><br />The follow up album to 2009s 'Thinnest Hopes Magnified' Shaun's outward journey continued across the length, and breadth of the U.K, stopping off for House concerts, and on location recordings. However, it's the journey within that has really taken new roads and routes as he lyrically delves deeper, looks inward, asks searching questions, confronts his inner demons, and yet ultimately errs on, and concludes on the positive side of life.<br /><br />While opting for a sparse sound, and production the old adage that less can mean so much more seems so so appropriate when you listen to this album.<br /><br />The simple, yet beautiful instrumentation of subtle guitars, strings plucked, and picked for harmony, body gently beaten for percussion, enhanced by occasional loop pedals, flutes, and keyboards form the basis of this opus.<br /><br />Over the top of this Hunter's rich, sonorous voice, redolent at times of a young Peter Gabriel, but ultimately with his own tone, and timbre, and emotive, and spiritual lyrics take us on a rewarding sojourn through an often unquiet mind.<br /><br />Having suffered tragedy as a child (his father died when he was very young) aspects of his songs are cathartic, yet ultimately provide positive answers.<br /><br />On the urgent, mesmerising, almost menacingly percussive 'From Cathedral Cities To Dark Northern Towns' the 'turbulent angst ridden child' discovers not only that 'a life worth living is tested', but also that 'a life worth living is found'. Seek and ye shall find it seems.<br /><br />Strike that match, light that candle, sit back and take it all in.<br /><br />On 'Beneath the wings of a Dragon' Hunter faces up to the fact that 'avoidance is a futile exercise' and stands up to his dragons and demons, cutting them down to size, while we are reminded that 'life is a people altering substance' on 'Completely by accident, not by design', but that it is up to us what we choose to make of it.<br /><br />Were he not one of the great contemporary lyricists he would no doubt be hailed as one of the great modern poets or thinkers of our time.<br /><br />Through Operatic scales, to eerie choral voices, hypnotic rhythm's, to confessional and emotive lyrics, and haunting melodies we ultimately come to the conclusion that Shaun is a man not content to sit still as he travels musically, physically, and mentally ultimately avoiding destination drudgery.<br /><br />This is an album cram packed full of profundity, pathos, and most importantly melody, and in 'Still Talking Scribble' he has created a masterpiece that stands alone, defies pigeonholing, and deserves to launch Shaun into the realm of the greatest songwriters of our time..</p>
