    <p>Leeds' Xi have announced that they are now part of the Pogomotion roster, alongside such up-and-coming acts as Candyheads and B-Movie Heroes. Talks over the last couple of weeks have resulted in a deal whereby Pogomotion will represent Xi at national level in the run-up to the release of their first album. Willie Tocher of Pogomotion said:<br><br>"We are delighted to announce the addition of Xi to the Pogomotion Roster, a band whom we believe have a great future ahead of them.  Through their innovative and unique musicianship and songwriting, Xi demonstrate their commitment to real music, which is what Pogomotion stands for - real music by real musicians, not the conveyor belt of instant pop noodle music, which is here today, gone tomorrow."<br><br>Panama Promotions will continue as Xi's business manager and will retain responsibility for local gigs, day-to-day matters and tour management. Steve Kind of Panama says:<br><br>"We are delighted that Pogomotion share our confidence in Xi, we will be working alongside them to raise the band's profile - you can expect serious Xi happenings in the next 18 months"<br><br>Xi will appear alongside their new stablemates B-Movie Heroes at the Royal Park Cellars to launch an Autumn mini-tour.<br><br>Visit www.pogomotion.co.uk for more details.</p>
