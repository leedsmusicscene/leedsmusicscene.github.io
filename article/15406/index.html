        <h1>Debian Blaks debut EP 'A hint of menace' out now!</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2011.</p>
    <p>There is some fresh new music from a producer that has been on our radar for a while now in the shape of Debian Blak. Another product of the vibrant Leeds music scene which has produced the likes of Ramadanman, kidkanevil, Submotion Orchestra and Nightmares On Wax, Debian Blak has been honing his skills as a producer since the age of 16. His passion for music began long before this, when at the tender age of 6 he first picked up the violin and began to tap away on the piano (not with the violin, mind).<br /><br />Fast forward to 2011 and Debian Blak is at the forefront of a generation of emerging creative artists in the UK. We first came across him when he remixed kidkanevil's Tokyorkshire track alongside Airhead back in 2009 - since then he's been developing his sound as a producer, both with his solo material and working with various bands and artists across the UK, most recently producing another new First Word act, East Park Reggae Collective (he is also the drummer for the band). <br /><br />A Hint of Menace is Debian Blak's debut release and is just a taster of what's to come from this promising artist in the coming months - drawing on influences including Mount Kimbie, James Blake and Jai Paul, as well as bringing his considerable musicianship to the fore, he has crafted a haunting, delicate EP that marks him out as one to watch.<br /><br />The EP is available for free through his bandcamp page.<br /><br />You can catch Debian Blak's live show (ft drummer Alvin Lee Ryan) at the Hi Fi Club on Wednesday 5th October, where they are supporting 'Daedelus'.</p>
