    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for Goodnight Seattle.</p>
    <p>I'm not here to show off amazing guitar skills or a beautiful voice, because I have neither. I am a Acoustic songwriter from Leeds. I've been writing my own songs for sometime and only just started singing about 6 months ago. I don't claim to have the best voice in the world or be the best guitar player in the world but its my passion and what I love doing. I've also played guitar before in my last two bands and played at venues such as Rio's, The Jug and Barrell, The Packhorse and The Cockpit. My music comes from the heart and is genuine. I'm not doing it to be anyone I'm not. It's something that makes me happy and if other people listen to it and enjoy it then I have achieved something. I hate the way the music industry has gone down hill and the generic scene where bands are just trying to get in the NME. I hate the X-Factor way of ruining songs and that people are simply becoming famous for having no talent but only the ability to sing someone else's song.<br /><br />Thanks......</p>
