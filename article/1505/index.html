    <p>Leeds band, Little Big Men, could be forgiven for thinking all their Christmas's have come at once this Sunday, as 6,000 women in shorts run towards them.<br><br>Booked, as part of the entertainment for the day, at the Race for Life 10th Anniversary run, the lads have the task of keeping the runners spurred on to cross the finishing line at Temple Newsam, to ensure as much money as possible is raised for Cancer Research UK.<br><br>Set to play over 15 songs, all original material, including hits such as Lord & Lady Muck and Long Black Legs, tracks which have rocked The Cockpit on many occasions, the lads will be based at the end of the 5k route.<br><br>With a very different audience to what they're used to, they are aware that they may have to choose the songs carefully, but see it as an opportunity to reach a wider audience.<br><br>Lead singer Wez Johnson said : "The chance to play at an event like this is wicked. We've got a lot of respect for everyone who's running. The day is set to raise a massive amount of money for charity, and we're looking forward to helping make it fun."<br><br>The band will be on hand from 11am-1pm. Also on the bill are Wakefield based Joe No More.</p>
