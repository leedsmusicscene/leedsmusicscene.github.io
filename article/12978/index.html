James Elson Leeds Music Scene Live Gig Review <br /><br />With the release of their new EP (and new band name) they are building on the fantastic opportunities and experience's they have had in their past whilst looking forward to what is in store for the band in the year to come. <br />The EP - which was produced by Andy Hawkins (Flogging Molly, Pulled Apart By Horses) and recorded at Cottage Road Studios in Leeds - draws upon a diverse array of influences, such as Ryan Adams, Kings of Leon, Simon & Garfunkel, Steely Dan, Bruce Springsteen, John Mayer and The Who.<br />The band are set to promote their new material (to be released January 2014) with shows at Kensington Roof Gardens, The Wardrobe, The Crusader and many more TBC.</p>
