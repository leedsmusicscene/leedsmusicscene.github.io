        <h1>Glass Caves announce the release of debut album 'Alive'</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2014.</p>
    <p>Due for release on 27th October via Tri-Tone (and distributed by PIASUK), Alive is the long awaited debut from the incredible Alt-Rock nomads, Glass Caves.  The LMS favourites have built a strong UK following busking their songs from city to city jumping from busy streets to sold out venues. The band have been touring relentlessly building a direct fanbase live and online where they were picked out by Billboard and Next Big Sound's "fastest accelerating" chart as one of the fasted growing bands on the internet. <br /><br />A BBC Introducing Radio 1 playlist saw recognition grow leading to a number of festival appearances including Leeds/Reading, Y-not Festival (for BBC Introducing), Shrewsbury Fields Forever, Live at Leeds and Tramlines (Sheffield). <br /><br />With debut album "Alive" which is produced by Rich Turvey (Darlia / The Mispers), and with the lead single "Go" Mastered by John Davis (Royal Blood / Catfish and the Bottlemen) Glass Caves blaze a trail of UK rock spawned from classic influences and adorned with contemporary production that is as muscular as it is refined and lustrous.  <br /><br />The album catalogues this restlessly active band's increasing ambitions as they are  adopted by growing audiences in cities they frequent playing on the streets. The result is a grand statement of intent with bombastic choruses interspersing more subtle references to concerns of the heart and spirit.<br /><br />Listen to "Go" below.<br /><br /><iframe width="100%" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/157503352&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true"></iframe><br /><br />Our advice is to see them before they get too big and start selling out venues up and down the country. They will play the Tri-tone Showcase at the Brudenell Social Club on Thursday 9th October (tickets at Yorkshire Gig Guide now) and again at Wakefield's Warehouse 23 on 25th October (tickets at Leeds Gig Tickets).</p>
