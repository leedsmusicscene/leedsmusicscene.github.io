    <p>On Sunday 2nd October, the cream of Leeds' retail scene donned their finest and gathered at the beautiful Metropole hotel in Leeds City Centre for the eagerly anticipated and undeniably glamorous Leeds Retail Awards 2011. <br /><br />Hosted by the Leeds Guide as an annual event to coincide with October's Leeds Loves Shopping festival, the Leeds Retail Awards offer Leeds' finest retailers a chance to receive a commendable and desirable award, voted for by Leeds Guide readers. <br /><br />The awards brought together a range of retailers from across the city, all dressed to the nines and eagerly, but nervously anticipating the award announcements. <br /><br />Jumbo Records owner Hunter Smith was ecstatic to pick up the 'Best Music' award saying:<br /><br />"We all feel very proud of our award for best retailer in the music category, especially as we pipped a national chain to the post.  I'm sure that many people voted for us because as an independent shop we have loyal and knowledgeable staff who give a personal service and are prepared to go to any length to source requests and hard to get titles for our customers".<br /><br />Hunter was also pleased to see such support for Leeds' independent businesses throughout the awards, saying;<br /><br />"It's so good to see so many nominations for Leeds based independent shops, and winners, at the Leeds Retail Awards which means the city is still a strong regional magnet for those people who like to spend some of their leisure time shopping".<br /><br />With Jumbo celebrating their 40th birthday this year (on 22nd October) it seems like perfect timing for them to pick up this prestigious award.<br /><br />Jumbo Records will celebrate their 40th birthday in style with bands playing in the shop, Revolutions Brewing Company making a special beer which will be on tap in a nice selection of pubs around Yorkshire, prizes and competitions. There are even rumours of special guests-a-plenty.<br /><br />Check out our Jumbo 40th Birthday event page for details.</p>
