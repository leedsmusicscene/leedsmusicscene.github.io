    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for Little Elvis.</p>
    <p>Little Elvis' stage presence, showmanship and entertainment value is beyond compare. Little Elvis has been entertaining audiences in and around Leeds for the past 3 years and his performances have proved popular with audiences, bands and venue owners alike. After supporting Marseille, Eureka Machines and many more successful bands and headlining at some of Leeds' première venues such as The Brudenell social Club where he was "discovered" while attending a gig, The Primrose Pub, The New Roscoe, and many many other venues its safe to say that he has proved very popular. Not satisfied with this, Little Elvis has gone on to wow critics being dubbed "Leeds' première Elvis Tribute Act" by Vibrations magazine atop of many other glowing reviews for performances at private venues, fundraisers, and even the White Rose Shopping Centre.<br /><br />Entertaining is certainly the best description of Little Elvis' stage show. From the first bars of "Thats Alright Mama" to the last line of "Cant Help Falling In Love" you can be guaranteed of one thing; laughter. His act is not about looking or sounding like Elvis but it is about keeping the spirit and music of "The King Of Rock N Roll" alive. His incomparable stage persona, DIY costumes replicating The King's own, and his utter fearlessness, Little Elvis assures that a good time is had by all without poking fun at the King himself.<br /><br />When asked about himself Little Elvis said <br />"I don't claim to have the best singing voice in the world, my show isn't about that, it's about entertainment. I love to make people laugh, to show people that music can be fun without being taken too seriously. I enjoy what I do and other people enjoy it, and that's enough for me."<br /><br />Not only a stage performer Little Elvis is also an experienced compère and is available to Compère any event. <br />The only way to truly understand what people are talking about is to experience Little Elvis live.<br /><br />See videos of Little Elvis here<br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Udn62gEXqHc<br />http://www.youtube.com/user/TheLilyVe#p/u/95/GxTLKqIweao<br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMvc-5FWH4Q<br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DZq1Oa20uQ&feature=related<br /><br />Little Elvis is available for Pubs, clubs, corporate events, private parties, and pretty much anywhere you want him to appear.
