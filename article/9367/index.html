    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for Widgykeff.</p>
    <p>Echoes of Widgykeff were first heard rolling off the Pennine hills way back in 2005. After a brief period of reinvention and a new drummer on board, the Keff launched themselves back to the fore fusing their original funk and psychedelic influences, with lashings of full frontal ballsy rock and a keen ear for melody and dynamic. <br /><br />Slowly stoking up a heavy local following, Widgykeff began to spread themselves across the North, quickly gaining a reputation as a stonking live act. This cumulated in the summer of 2008 with the band winning the prestigious Keighley Music Centre battle of the bands competition, along with 2 out of the 4 individual awards. <br /><br />In September 2008, Widgykeff headed to the studio in a bid to capture the energy of their live set on record. An albums worth of material was recorded and the results were beyond expectations. Local independent label King Prawn Records were alerted to the ruckus and offered a deal to release debut album "A Town Of Alcoholic Children" on CD and digital download. <br /><br />Monday 22nd December saw a 250+ sell out home town gig at the Hebden Bridge Trades Club celebrating the album launch with over 150 copies of the album sold on pre-release. <br /><br />2009 is set to be one hell of a year!<br /><br />www.widgykeff.com<br />www.kingprawnrecords.co.uk.</p>
