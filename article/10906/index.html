    <p>The Bear Driver, the up-and-coming four piece psych-pop-indie band from Leeds, have been chosen as one of nine bands out of the 950+ that entered the competition to play End of the Road festival this summer. The festival takes place in Dorset between the 11th and 13th September.<br><br>On 27th July The Bear Driver will see their track ‘Mind Attack’ released on the second of the Dance to the Radio vinyl compilation 4x12” series. The release will be accompanied by a new music video directed by filmmaker Lawrence Solon-Parry.<br><br>In May the band released their ‘Paws and Claws’ EP. The single was championed by Radio 1's Huw Stephens who declared it his personal ‘Pick of the Week’ and the first track of the EP – ‘A Thousand Samurais’ - has been doing the BBC Introducing radio rounds accompanied by Huw’s personal recorded message. Tracks from the 'Paws and Claws' EP continue to have radio play on BBC’s Radio 1, Radio 2 and 6 Music channels.</p>
