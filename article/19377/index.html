    <p>Long Division Festival is set to return next June 2016 and this week its organisers announced the first acts, cementing the festival as supporters of independence and DIY Culture. <br /><br />Long Division will host 90 bands across 7 venues in Wakefield city centre over the weekend of the 10th to 12th June 2016.<br /><br />The first two acts announced embody what Long Division is trying to achieve. Hailing from Glasgow, Bis' joyous and dedicated approach to the DIY attitude and aesthetic makes them a perfect match.<br /><br />Los Campesinos! are returning to the festival after creating the festival's first ever 'were you there?' moment in 2011 when they took to the stage at the 150-capacity venue The Hop. It was sheer amazing chaos. <br /><br />Cementing the ethos of the festival and new for the 2016 edition, bands can apply to play through a simple form on the Long Division website via the artist submission. This function has been set up in collaboration with Music Glue.<br /><br />Tickets for the Saturday are now on sale, keeping the 2015 price of £25. Building on and trying to get more young festival goers into music, they are now offering a reduction to just £15 for 18 to 21 year olds and £10 for 16 and 17 year olds, making Long Division one of the best value and friendliest festivals around.<br /><br />Tickets can be bought from the Long Division website.</p>
