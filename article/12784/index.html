    <p>Holy State have teamed up with Leeds independent label Dance To The Radio for the release of their EP 'Holy State'. The EP will be released on CD and Digital Download formats on 12th July 2010.<br /><br />The EP was recorded at Leeders Farm in Norfolk by Lawrence Eaves (Lovvers), and is released as a digipack CD package with a hand printed tote bag and t-shirt. The releases features four tracks: 1. Brain Caves; 2. The Beaus and the Oglers; 3. Skull on Skull; and 4. Palms.<br /><br />Although this self-titled EP is their first proper EP, Holy State have previously released split singles with Pulled Apart by Horses and Brontide, and were featured on Huw Stephen's 'Music Sounds Better With Huw - Volume 1' compilation.<br /><br />DTTR first worked with Holy State last year, releasing the brutal 'Jagged Lines' on the 2nd of the 4x12" vinyl compilations. <br /><br />In 2009 Holy State opened up the now legendary DTTR Stage at Leeds Festival and played to 7,000 music fans on a bill that also included Blood Red Shoes, Wild Beasts, Bear Hands and Airship.<br /><br />Holy State play live in Leeds at the Cardigan Arms tonight (14th May) and again at The Well on 21st July as part of the Wolves Festival.</p>
