    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2009.</p>
    <p>For the past 6 weeks Leeds city refuge collectors have been on strike, and on Sunday, 18th October musicians and comedians from Leeds (and beyond!) are gathering at the O2 Academy venue in Leeds to cause a stir and let the powers that be know the terms offered to the men and women that keep are city clean are not OK.<br><br>Keith Allen will be making his Leeds debut and – joined by his 12-piece band – will be hitting the stage of the O2 Academy to perform a raucous selection of tunes.<br><br>Playing with Keith on the night will be Leeds bands Middleman, who made an appearance at Leeds Festival this summer after winning Futuresound 2009, and Matt Skint, aka Wakefield’s Skint & Demoralised. Chunky Butt Funky will be compere for the night.<br><br>Paul Kenny, GMB General Secretary and Dave Prentis Unison General Secretary will attend the event and both will speak at the rally and will attend the picket line on Monday 19th October.<br><br>Desiree Risebury, GMB Organiser said, “We look forward to this event raising much needed support for the workers on strike in Leeds who face crippling pay cuts. This is a way for people in Leeds to tell the Lib Dem/Tory administration that the proper way to introduce equal pay is to increase the wage of the women worker up to that of the men.”</p>
