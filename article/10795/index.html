    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for Holy State.</p>
    <p>Holy State are a rock band from England. The band established itself in Leeds through a mutual passion for '90s alternative rock, particularly from US labels such as Dischord, Sub Pop, Touch & Go, and from pioneering artists such as PJ Harvey and Girls Against Boys. In November 2008 they played their first show in the basement of legendary local venue Royal Park Cellars. They released their first demo on Holy Roar Records in 2009, and throughout the year continued to release split vinyl singles on a variety of labels with a variety of bands, including Pulled Apart By Horses, Brontide, Suckers, and Das Racist. Ethics of hard work and friendship have led to extensive touring and numerous festival appearances, their infectious loud and warm sound turning unsuspecting ears. Notorious for making sound guys suffer, their live shows are often too loud, leading to the common request "Could you turn down please?", to which the members can only apologise and explain that the amps are simply too old and powerful. <br /><br />Recently, they released a self-titled EP on UK indie label Dance To The Radio, which received great critical reception and extensive radio play. Their new digital single, 'Medicine Hat / Sultan of Sentiment', was released November 22nd, and is available through iTunes and other large digital retailers.<br /><br />Currently they are working on their debut album, due out at some point next year..</p>
