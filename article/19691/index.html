    <p>Demon Music Group's label Edsel have reissued the first two albums by The Music as 2CD Deluxe Editions.<br /><br />Formed in Leeds, the band adopted the name Insense when they played their first gigs circa 1999, before changing their name to The Music. Steve Lamacq hailed The Music as the "best unsigned band in Britain", and after a single on the Fierce Panda label, the band was signed to Hut Records.<br /><br />Produced by Jim Abbiss, the band's eponymously titled debut was originally issued in September 2002, achieving Gold Disc status in the UK, Japan and Australia. The new release includes sixteen bonus non-album EP tracks and B-sides.<br /><br />'Welcome To the North' was released in 2004 and went Gold again. The reissue includes non-album B-sides and a bonus disc of dance-orientated remixes of singles taken from the album.<br /><br />Watch the video to 'Take The Long Road And Walk It' below.<br /><br /><iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xGkSl-rATfo?list=PLfOWttrfVmg3-yl7383CasYcv3unZCVqF" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
