        <h1>Rodina - Over The Sun</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Over The Sun" recorded by Rodina. The review was written by Joseph C Seager in 2009.</p>
    <p>There are a lot of female vocalists out there at the moment, none though, who have quite the same intrigue as Aoife Hearty from Rodina. Her beautiful vocals combined with the masses of talent that feature on this debut album equals a genuine passion and love for all things music.<br /><br />From the Latin influenced 'Always Had a Dream' at the top of the playlist, which could quite easily be included on a Hollywood feature soundtrack, right down to the simplicity yet magic of 'Hold That Thought,' 'Over The Sun' is an album of great range. Each song is catchy in its own way, yet also relaxing, soulful, embracing, mysterious and to be honest, quite sexy.<br /><br />I'm a big fan of 'You Cry I Cry,' in fact, every song delivers something exceptional. With the strong backbone of Aoife Hearty's voice giving stability and wonder to each individual track, it allows all the featuring musicians to bring something different to the party. Throw it all in a blender, leave the lid off, and you've got the sound of Rodina splashed all over your walls. Look out for performances all over Yorkshire in the coming months including the Hifi Club (16th Feb), Royal Park Cellars (12th March) and The Blues Cafe Bar in Harrogate in July. Delightful songs with a charming delivery not only make this album such a find, but Rodina itself a name to watch out for. It's classic, absolute classic.</p>
