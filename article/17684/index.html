    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for Duncan McFarlane.</p>
    <p>Duncan McFarlane has played folk festivals, clubs and folk-venues all across the UK, France and Denmark as a solo artist (as well as with his folk-rock six-piece band 'The Duncan McFarlane Band, his acoustic trio and as a duo with fiddler Anne Brivonese). There's been many BBC and local radio plays (and live appearances!) to match the tireless live shows extending back the past 14 years. Five-star reviews in R2 and other publications for his albums are matched by high-praise reviews for his live work... 'Classy English Folk Guitar, eminently listenable vocals and great songs, both traditional and contemporary'  (Mike Raven)  <br /> 'Duncan's a punchy guitarist in the 'English folk' style and offers a set about equally split between his own songs, other people's and traditional'  (fRoots) <br /> 'Duncan has an obvious feel for the tradition and a deep-rooted belief that it has a place in the current folk scene, <br /> aspects which he puts across with lively showmanship. 'His own songs show a canny grasp of, and response to, the tradition, while his intrinsic seriousness of intent and approach is often laced with a healthy irreverence that happens to be hugely entertaining'  (Living Tradition).</p>
