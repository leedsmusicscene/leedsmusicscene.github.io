        <h1>Xi - Learning</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Learning" recorded by Xi. The review was written by Dave Sugden in 2001.</p>
    <p>A teaser track from their forthcoming album, "Learning" begins with a fantastic guitar into; its not complicated but it certainly has attitude in a serious rock sense; a style they are not commonly associated with. However, Xi are unashamedly a prog rock band and a quick return-to-what-you-do best is in order.  Something that becomes evident once vocalist Daz takes the mic.<Br><br>Whilst this is very well produced and highlights them as a good band, the downside is whether this is a sound that Leeds' music fans want to hear.<Br><br>There's no doubt that Xi will - and should - continue to do exactly what they enjoy doing.  But I fear for them.  Despite their technical ability and talent, it may be a little irrelevant if they have a diminished audience to start with.  Shame, but here's hoping...</p>
