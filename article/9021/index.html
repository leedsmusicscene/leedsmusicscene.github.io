        <h1>Shatner release their second album</h1>

    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2007.</p>
    <p>Shatner have released their second album, entitled 'Thirteen O'Clock'. Appropriately containing 13 tracks, the album was co-produced by Will Jackson whose credits include The Pigeon Detectives' recent hits as well as working with Forward Russia and Kaiser Chiefs.<br><br>It's been three years since Shatner's debut album 'Energise' which achieved critical acclaim wherever it went and is now in its fourth pressing. The new album has taken over a year to make and is something of an epic, reflecting the band's creatively ambitious outlook. Early reviews are very positive and suggest that the album offers a unique take on indie pop.<br><br>The band launched the album twice, once in London with a headline gig at the Clapham Grand theatre, and once in Leeds with a near sell-out gig at Joseph's Well. During 2007 the four piece Shatner became a six piece with the addition of Sarah Niven and Claire Gibbons on backing vocals. The launch gigs also featured Rob Chapman on trombone and, at the Leeds gig, Tash Koczy on sax (both of whom appear on the album).<br><br>It is currently available over the internet from the band's site and at selected record shops. Wider distribution may follow. There are no immediate plans to make it available for download.</p>
