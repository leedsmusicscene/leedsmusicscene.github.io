        <h1>Orka - Untitled</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Untitled" recorded by Orka. The review was written by Dave Sugden in 2002.</p>
    <p>Previously plagued by critique suggesting they are a one-song band, Orka deliver a two-fingered salute in the form of a primarily home-recorded demo CD.  After the aforementioned "one-song" opens up, all focus is on how well the remaining songs compare... and they stand up well, dispelling any fear the band's creativity may have declined in recent times.<Br><Br>An 80's disco/electronica drumbeat opens up the second track "Crush", before the guitar wrecks all sense of pop with an injection of fuzzed-up noise in full glory. Imagine Hole's "Celebrity Skin" with more glam and less rawk: "Live like a rock star, when you're drowning in a fast car, take the pills to kill the din, the water's past your chin, crush, crush".  For everything that "She" is, "Crush" isn't... a full-on energy rush that exemplifies their Muse-esque mix of rock'n'roll, noise and beauty.<Br><Br>Back to the start and a subtly different version to that which they recorded in 2001; "She" now impresses with a cleaner guitar base which, coupled with improved drumming, intertwines well with Coyle's excellent vocal delivery, "As a matter of fact, the kids came back, the way they always do, but now they won't stop loving you".  With an intrinsic beauty "She" is amazingly crafted; one of, if not <I>the</I>, best track written by any local act in the past five years, this is the quality of songwriting other bands should be striving to achieve.</p>
