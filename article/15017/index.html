    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2011.</p>
    <p>Honour Before Glory is the new solo project from Whiskas (¡Forward, Russia! / Dance To The Radio).<br /><br />While relatively little material has so far emmerged, what has, has already been picked up by the likes of Steve Lamacq and Huw Stephens, and warranted comparisons as varied as M83, Wolf Parade and My Bloody Valentine by a host of blog admirers.<br /><br />The album, 'this is broken lines', is the result of 4 years of playing, messing around, learning and coming to terms with being in a band with no one else to fall back on - the freedom and the constraints of having no one to answer to.<br /><br />Featuring additional help from friends from bands such as I Like Trains, Duels, Shut Your Eyes & You'll Burst Into Flames - as well as being mastered by Tom from ¡Forward, Russia! - the album was entirely produced by Whiskas in Leeds, largely last Summer, with the finishing sprinkles of gloss being added in the first half of this year. This extended period of finalisation has led to the impetus to release it almost immediately upon completion.<br /><br />'this is broken lines' is available now on immediate download, through the official website honourbeforeglory.com. Honour Before Glory are also making available a free download single, 'Breaker', which is available now through the band's website.<br /><br />The album will be released nationally in October.</p>
