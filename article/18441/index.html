    <p>The first ever Ship-Tones live experience is finally happening with a full 10 piece live band of some of Leeds best musicians alongside video projections and vocals of some rather well-known singers from Vaccines, Kaiser Chiefs, Cribs, Edwin Collins and Inspiral Carpets.  This you do not want to miss.  <br /><br />The Ship-Tones is an exciting new outfit from Leeds, re-working indie rock hits and uniting the vocals of the original front men from each band with a re-written and re-interpreted reggae style backing. The brain-child of Chris 'Shippo' Shipton and prolific reggae guitarist Chris Campbell, The Ship-Tones merges the ideas, riffs and structures of the original compositions and creates a whole new cross-over with a true live band feel. <br /><br />Chris 'Shippo' Shipton is a studied musician who has toured the world as Tech/TM for various bands over the past 10 years. Whilst on the road he has continued building a recorded back-catalogue of music with Chris Campbell.<br /><br />Check out their cover of The Cribs<br /><br /><iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/_PRu_PJySYM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br /><br />Also appearing, are LMS Favourites Fold, an experimental trip hop four piece based in Leeds.  In place of a front man they use speech samples, exploring the natural rhythms of the human voice while expressing commonly held concerns through the words of eloquent speakers past and present.  Playing everything live with visuals their live show is an experience.  <br /><br />Recently interviewed for The Guardian music blog as part of their Breaking Bands series. Fold's recent EP Salvation has been singled out by Lauren Laverne and Don Letts on BBC 6 Music as well as John Kennedy on Xfm.<br /><br /><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/64591400&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_artwork=true"></iframe><br /><br />Tickets are on sale at Jumbo & Crash</p>
