    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for The Stations.</p>
    <p>With supports slots with bands such as The Holloway's, Dartz!, Komakino, Blackwire, The Heights and The Motorettes, The Stations are definitely on the rise. With their debut single due out at Easter (30-04-07) and more dates coming up around the country you should be hearing a lot of the 3 guys from Halifax and Hebden Bridge, West Yorkshire. <br />
<br />
Brothers Ben and Sean moved to England after a childhood in Hamburg, Germany and quickly began learning their trade in the gaden shed. Meanwhile, Steve had been playing around in numerous local bands, which is where the three met. A friendship began and The Stations formed in mid 2004.<br />
<br />
With a hard work ethic, The Stations made their name playing local pubs in order to fund their debut 6 track EP, Missing Words. As the year went on, newer songs showed a greater maturity and diversity in style. A 2nd EP This Globe Can Be Upgraded was recorded in early 2006 to great reviews in local music press, earning the band a slot on the prestigious Leeds Festival Futuresound Competition along side eventual winners Dead Disco and SYEAYBIF.<br />
<br />
Summer 2006 saw the band head out on a self-promoted 15+ date tour. After an impressive first performance at the Escobar, the Stations were invited back for their first major support slot with Blackwire less than a month later. <br />
<br />
A clear boost in the bands popularity was given in these few months leading up to their 2nd Manchester Academy show where local indie label Science Fiction Theatre took notice and agreed to release the band's debut single 'Primadonna' on Mon 30th April.<br />
<br />
This Globe Can Be Upgraded has since been reworked to include new material and is available now from:<br />
