    <p>The Seven Inches have announced the release of their début album, 'The Seven Inches Get Disorientated', on 12th August 2013 through Sturdy Records.<br /><br />Following their Sturdy Records début 'Peruvian Poncho' last November, the long-awaited release of their first album is, in some quarters, cause for national celebration. <br /><br />Twelve incredible songs about little things, wanting to be the second coolest person in town, openness and honesty, dressing up, underachieving, cartoons and boating lakes - each one a improbable life-affirming gem, each one a glorious flashback to a time when it wasn't a contradiction in terms to be this singular while still totally in love with the pop dream.<br /><br />The Seven Inches have long been heroes amongst Leeds' indiepop and DIY scenes. They've also played all over the country, including Indietracks festival, support slots with Jeffrey Lewis, The Long Blondes and more, winning hearts everywhere with their bizarre onstage props, trumpets, synths and cardboard keytars.<br /><br />Teaser single 'The Little Things' - four minutes of rousing, heartfelt fizzy indiepop glory - comes out July as a free download via theseveninches.bandcamp.com. <br /><br />The album launch gig takes place at the Brudenell Social Club in Leeds on Saturday 10th August.</p>
