    <p>four day Hombre release their Radio One acclaimed First Word is the Hardest debut single on July 7th. Having already been featured on Xfm, the band were played on Jo Whiley, Mark & Lard, Sarah Cox, Chris Moyles and the Evening Session after they sent a demo version of the track to Steve Lamacq looking for a Session Unsigned slot.<Br><br>four day Hombre have toured extensively through the country, honing their sound and constantly striving to make each show better than the last. Support dates and tours with bands as varied and well known as The Coral, And You Will Know Us By The Trail of The Dead, JJ72 and Aereogramme demonstrate the complete commitment of four day Hombre to their music. Keyboard player Ed puts it best when he describes their sound as "...really honest. We want to be the quietest, most moving band and the loudest, most uplifting band in the world all at the same time." A contradiction no doubt but one that is easily explained by all who have seen them live.<Br><br>Jo Whiley describes the lead track as "scorching and beautiful in all the right places" and the three songs on the EP ably demonstrate the power and emotional intensity of the five piece.<br><br>We gave it 5/5. Check it out!</p>
