    <p>Long Division has always been a firm favourite with the LMS team and we could not be happier to support them with their Crowdfunding campaign to secure the future of the 2016 event.  <br /><br />Launched just a few days ago, they are close to their target of raising £6,000, but they need your to help bring the music festival to life.  Following a cut in vital funding in 2015 the festival can no longer afford to operate without generating funds from other areas.<br /><br />We all want to see Long Division return, year after year, supporting and ensuring the vibrant Wakefield music scene is kept alive. <br /><br />Dean Freeman, organiser and founder of Long Division said: "Looking back, I think what Long Division has achieved in 5 years is amazing. There was never a huge plan, but it has successfully celebrated DIY and Independent Culture to such an extent that I think it would be disastrous to the city, but also the wider region and DIY scene nationally if it disappeared."<br /><br />"A Crowdfunder puts it in the hands of the fans, the local businesses and the artists, the way it was always meant to be." <br /><br />Fans can chose from a variety of unique experiences and packages for 2016 in return for their support, including the chance to perform backing vocals on a live album recording and spend the weekend getting the full VIP treatment with a hotel stay.<br /><br />There are also different packages for local businesses from the chance to sponsor the festival's t-shirts to naming a stage.<br /><br />The Crowdfunding campaign launches today and will close on 21 October.  The Crowdfunding rules mean the festival has to raise the full £6,000 for receive any of the money pledged.<br /><br />To find out more about the Long Division Crowdfunding campaign visit the website .<br /><br />http://www.crowdfunder.co.uk/longdivision2016<br /><br /><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sQCaaeJBvh0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
