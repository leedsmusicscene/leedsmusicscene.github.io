    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2012.</p>
    <p>Gary Stewart has announced the release of his 'Year and a Day' EP, which will be available through the Babaganoush Records label on 18th June.<br /><br />The EP, which comes in CD card wallet, 10" vinyl and Digital Download formats, takes you right back to likes of Neil Young's 'Harvest' and early Joan Baez whilst remaining contemporary alongside modern folk breakthroughs such as Laura Marling and Momford and Sons.<br /><br />Scotland born and now based in Leeds, the Perthshire boy caught the attention and imagination of traditional and modern music lovers up and down the U.K with the release of his debut album, "Boy Cries Wolf". <br /><br />The album featured performances from Ellen Smith (Ellen and the Escapades) and Rosie Doonan (Radio 2 Folk Award nominee/Rosie Doonan + Ben Murray/Peter Gabriel) and picked up support from BBC Radio 2<br /><br />'Year and a day' is a beautifully written EP which honours Gary Stewart's craft as one of the most distinct singer/songwriters in the UK. It opens with the tender 'Thorns' followed by 'Eve', both tracks gracious and elegant. 'Green' jumps out as the penultimate track, raising the tempo, brimming full of Celtic charm. 'Blue' closes the four-track EP, an expansive and warm song packed full of soaring harmonies.</p>
