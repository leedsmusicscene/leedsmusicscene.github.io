        <h1>The Cribs to headline at Long Division 2014</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2014.</p>
    <p>The Cribs will play their first public hometown show in seven years at this year's Long Division Festival.<br /> <br />The band will play at Unity Hall on the opening Friday night of the festival kicking off a full weekend of music, art and comedy across Wakefield city centre.<br /> <br />The Wedding Present will play on Saturday night at the festival and will be joined by Gruff Rhys, Toy, Summer Camp, Roddy Woomble, I Like Trains, Frankie & The Heartstrings, The Membranes, Beans On Toast, Candy Says, Post War Glamour Girls, Bleech, Brawlers, Islet, Joel RL Phelps, Randloph's Leap, Witch Hunt, Jamie Roberts & Katriona Gilmore, Milloy, The Ainsley Band, VerseChorusVerse, Nadine Carina, Treason Kings, The Sunbeams, Ruby Macintosh, The Reacharounds, The Grand, Protectors, Mi Mye, Knuckle, Gunnarson, Forever Cult, Clandestines, Aztec Doll, Jamisaysmile and many more to be announced.<br /> <br />Speaking about The Cribs' return to Wakefield, Gary Jarman said: "The last couple of years it's been pretty difficult not to have been aware of Long Division, even on a national level. Wakefield really seems to be standing up on its own now when it comes to the arts, and Long Division is an important piece of that. To have great bands come through your hometown like Jeffery Lewis, The Wedding Present, Herman Dune and The Vaselines is pretty amazing, and this year we are really excited to be a part of it.<br /> <br />"We don't get chance to play Wakefield as much as we did in the early days, particularly with two of us living in the USA now, so our 'hometown' shows are now a special occasion for us.  With us currently being in between records, this year seems like the perfect opportunity."<br /> <br />This year's festival will run from Friday 12th - Sunday 14th September. Venues so far include Unity Hall (two stages), Warehouse 23, The Orangery, Henry Boons, Westgate Chapel and Players.<br /> <br />Tickets for The Cribs are priced at £30 with tickets for Saturday priced at £22.50. This year a limited number of VIP tickets will be available for £50. This gives access to all the Saturday events as well as The Cribs Friday gig and can be purchased via Yorkshire Gig Guide or by visiting Wah Wah Records (Wakefield), Jumbo Records (Leeds), Crash Records (Leeds), Debut Records (Barnsley).</p>
