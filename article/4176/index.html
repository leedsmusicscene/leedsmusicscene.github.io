    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for Cara Robinson.</p>
    <p> Even during the early stages of her career, Cara Robinson was writing and recording with notable artists from a huge range of musical genres, including David Holmes, LTJ Bukem and upcoming EMI artist, Corrine Bailey-Ray. She has toured throughout the UK as a session singer, backing singer and solo artist. As a backing singer for Sony's Rhianna, she toured Japan and the UK, supporting Jamiroquai and Beverly Knight. Her soulful, thoughtful and innocent voice has feaured on various documentaries for Ulster TV.<br><bR>Keeper Lit is Cara's impressive debut album, which she wrote and produced with keyboard player Joe Tatton. the closeness of the band has been established over years of working together and is audible in the tightness of the grooves and subtleties of the tunes.<br><bR>The collaborative work ignores all musical boundaries and acknowledges all that is good about blues, folk, alt-country and rock, giving more than a nod of gratitude to Cara's roots in Northern Ireland.<br><bR>While unclassifiable, it's an album which could easily be racked up there with Dusty Springfield, Carlene Anderson, Fiona Apple and Moloko..</p>
