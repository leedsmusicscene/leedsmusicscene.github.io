        <h1>The Glitterati - You Got Nothing on Me</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "You Got Nothing on Me" recorded by The Glitterati. The review was written by Holden DeForge in 2005.</p>
    <p>It's like 1986 all over again. Mike Clink has picked up on five sleazy young men with a self belief bordering on arrogance, honed their raw talents and added the layer that separates great from greatness. A thudding bounce of drums, leads us to a nonchalent guitar intro before vocalist Paul Gautrey signals the cavalry with a scream.<br><br>The groove powers along in the background as Gautrey elongates each vowel to a sexy drawl, tricking us into thinking the chorus is coming but, like a good lover, merely teasing us and leaving us waiting for more.<br><br>When the chorus does come it's delivered as pure fact and is bound to become an anthem of defiance for rock fans everywhere, with the harmonies hammering home the point. John Emsley's guitar has its neck wrung like a cartoon character as he pours notes out of it like bourbon onto the ample breasts of a girl in the front row of a David Lee Roth show. The song breaks down for brief respite before Gautrey's whisper builds to a howl and The Glitterati pull out leaving us gagging for more.</p>
