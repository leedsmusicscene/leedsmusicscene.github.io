        <h1>Yes Boss - See It Through</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "See It Through" recorded by Yes Boss. The review was written by Nick Rowan in 2007.</p>
    <p>Waiting in the shadows, Yes Boss watched closely as others quickly burnt out on mediocre releases. They took their time, honing their skills. Now, finally, the name up in lights is their own and the rap-punk-grime-techno duo are primed to drop their debut album (‘Look Busy’) on the 5th of February. This is the lead-in 12”/download single, a preparatory air assault all set to shake the dancefloors and start the commotion.<br><br>Yes Boss might find themselves singled out as a DTTR anomaly, token hip-hop signings there to add a touch of street authenticity. The argument doesn’t entirely ring true. Indeed though Yes Boss blend garage and hip-hop on this single rather than math and rock, their sights remain set on the local community. As well as remixing and crossovers with (among others) This Et Al, ¡Forward, Russia! and The Sunshine Underground, they provide acid-tongued commentary on recognisable scenarios including the fragile psyche and fallen dreams of your average local scenester. That’s public service right there.<br><br>At least they did until now. As the intro bumps and thumps Noah sets the track up as, “Something nice for you/ Giving you a bit of a good message with this one”. They lay down a danceable groove built on funky basslines, stop/start synth chords and shake-your-thing drum rhythms. The beat is set up perfectly for Noah to deliver the payoff and his vocals hit their marks but the impact is held in check by the positive constraint, as if he’s unable to find an appropriate tack without a visible target.<br><br>Understandably he falls back in to a more familiar stream of establishing the Yes Boss credentials and ripping up the opposition in entertaining fashion (“You’re about as hot as a frozen pie”), but the track suffers from one of Noah’s own criticisms - a lack of focus. By the closing stages, with the verses running at cross-purposes to the constructive chorus, he seems to adopt a scattergun approach clumsily bundling in lines that are irrelevant, like a school kid cribbing extra points in to his homework at the last minute: “Cops got questions / I don’t say shit / ‘Cause a grass gets cut like a lawnmower”. This may sound sharp when taken out of context but the overall result is a disjointed flow.<br><br>Yes Boss made their name with ‘Indie Kids’ and ‘Meet The Boss’, but ‘See It Through’ falls just short of the same high standard. As they principally function within the indie scene you can’t help but feel that Yes Boss will need to stay as tight as a Yorkshireman to keep the bright lights from fading.</p>
