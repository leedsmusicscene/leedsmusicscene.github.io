    <p>CHINA RATS announce the release of their new single and video N.O.M.O.N.E.Y from their forthcoming "Don't Play With Fire" EP.  Available on September 30th (iTunes) and October 14th (vinyl)<br /><br />Got N.O.M.O.N.E.Y?  Get Into Gigs For Free / 'Pay What you Can' for the EP<br /><br />The Don't Play With Fire EP will be available through all usual channels but, in keeping with the sentiment of N.O.M.O.N.E.Y, it will be available on a 'pay what you can' basis through Bandcamp at http://chinarats.bandcamp.com.  <br /><br />China Rats are also giving away free entry to all their headline dates for the first five people who turn up and can prove that they have 'no money'. Free entry will be at the discretion of the venues so people are advised to "get creative"!  <br /><br />The Don't Play With Fire EP kicks off with the swaggeringly brilliant N.O.M.O.N.E.Y (No Money), a song that perfectly encapsulates the perennial frustration of empty-pocketed youth that's more pertinent than ever before in the Current Economic Climate.  The song is accompanied by a wonderful stop-motion video fashioned of coins and notes by acclaimed animator Richard Swarbrick. Better known for his animations of Gareth Bale, Wayne Rooney and Lionel Messi and his work for Adidas, Google, Sky Sports and NBC, Swarbrick has spent the last 15 months making this video in his spare time.<br /><br />Watch new single N.O.M.O.N.E.Y <br /><br /><iframe width="640" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/v8IQXHPBhR0?feature=player_detailpage" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br /><br />Tour dates are as follows:<br /><br />The band are also starting their UK tour with a hometown show in Leeds - Brudenell Social Club on October 1st.<br /><br />Leeds Show: <br />https://www.facebook.com/events/308187932656482/<br />Leeds Tickets: <br />http://www.seetickets.com/event/china-rats/brudenell-games-room/728005<br /><br />October<br />1 Leeds Brudenell Social Club<br />2 Nottingham Bodega<br />3 Bristol Louisiana<br />5 Birmingham Sunflower Lounge<br />6 Liverpool Korova<br />7 Leicester Lock 42<br />8 Brighton Green Door Store<br />9 London Sebright Arms</p>
