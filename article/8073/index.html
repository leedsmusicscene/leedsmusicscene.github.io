    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for Mercurial.</p>
    <p>Mercurial is a new sound phenomenon, formed in the summer of 2005. The dedicated team of innovators locked themselves in a basement and started distilling ideas into songs. Mercurial emerged playing live shows, complete with samples linking each song together forming a refined, focused set.<br /><br />Many years gigs and songs passed until early 2008 when Mercurial hit the studio to record and master, <br /><br />Then in September 2008 Mercurial surfaced, clutching their first full length, self produced album "No Humans Attached" <br /><br />The album is over an hour long with 8 full tracks linked by original soundscapes that will blow your mind!<br /><br />Along with the album we have got a brand new myspace where you can buy and order our CD's and merchandise, check out the latest news and download all of our new artwork......<br /><br />Coming soon we will have FREE 2 track sampler CD's that contain tracks taken from the album each with individual artwork designed especially by us for the CD's, to let you have a taste of what the album is all about.<br /><br />We are launching a full website (www.mercurial.tv) shortly where you will be able to listen to all the tracks via our interactive media player and also buy merchandise/T-shirts. <br /><br />Pick up the album now for a mere £5 via our online shop here http://mercurial.bigcartel.com/. <br /><br />All we can say is we feel it has been worth the wait and we can't wait to get back out there gigging with a new set. Hope to see you there...<br /><br />LISTEN TO THE TASTERS AND SINGLE 'Neharetin 7' AND WATCH THIS SPACE!<br /><br />Mercurial xx<br /><br />Paul Walsh - Vocals<br />Chris Green - Guitar<br />Adam Pickering - Bass<br />Hamid Tavakoli - Drums.</p>
