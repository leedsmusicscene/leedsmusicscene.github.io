    <p>Young Guns will be making their return to Leeds, playing The Key Club on Saturday 4th April, ahead of their anticipated third album 'Ones and Zeros' which is set to be released on the 8th June. <br /><br />The band announced their return earlier this year. Chatting to Zane Lowe on Radio1, who gave their first single 'I Want Out' the accolade of 'Hottest Record in the World', Gustav Wood said "We literally can't wait to get back out on the road and play a load of new songs for you."  <br /><br />Young Guns confirmed 20 dates on their headline tour, kicking off on Friday 27th March in Oxford and closing in Sheffield on the 10th June. Tickets for their Leeds gig on 4th April can be purchased via Leeds Gig Tickets.<br /><br />You can read our interview with Gustav Wood and Fraser Taylor after their Leeds Festival set, or pre-order the album 'Ones and Zeros'.</p>
