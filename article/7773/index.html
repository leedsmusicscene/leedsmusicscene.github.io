    <p>The future of the Brudenell Social Club in Hyde Park looks safer this week after an application for £10,000 of lottery money was successful - the grant will be paid on Christmas Day.<br><bR>The Brudenell Entertainments Committee, a volunteer organisation attached to the Social Club, was awarded the grant from the lottery funding organisation Awards For All.<br><bR>The Committee has been working for 18 months on fundraising to secure the future of the Brudenell. In early 2005, noise complaints threatened the future of the Club, and the Committee raised more than £7,000 for soundproofed fire doors.<br><bR>The lottery grant will go towards a new PA System with the Committee aiming to raise a further £5,000 through gigs, bring and buy sales and a New Years Eve party. The grant will also be used to soundproof a back room, providing a rehearsal space and the facilities for volunteers to offer workshops to residents on events management and sound engineering.<br><bR>Councillor James Monaghan supported the application and said, “I am glad to have played a small part in the bid that will benefit the music scene in Leeds and local community organisations. The Brudenell Social Club Entertainments Committee have put a huge amount of work into seeing this project come to fruition and they should be praised for their efforts”.<br><bR>In recent years the venue has hosted secret gigs by Kaiser Chiefs and Franz Ferdinand, as well as hundreds of local, national and international acts. And on New Years Eve the Committee will be holding a party to celebrate the grant, with live music, entertainment and DJs.<br><bR>Tickets cost £5 and are available now from the Brudenell bar or from Jumbo Records.</p>
