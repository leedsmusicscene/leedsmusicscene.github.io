    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for Quentins Basement.</p>
    <p>Quentin's Basement are a four piece Indie-Rock band from Leeds with a passion for bouncy tunes and catchy riffs. The band are four happy Yorkshire gentlemen with a passion for indie rock and tight trousers. With a set full of songs fuelled by ex-loves, Friday nights and beer what more could you ask for? They make it obvious they are a close group of friends as soon as they take the stage, making the crowd feel at ease, providing a guaranteed top show!<br />Having formed in 2010 they have since played numerous gigs and festivals. The band is starting to make a name for themselves around Yorkshire. Having opened for "The View" and "General Fiasco" as well as supporting The Strypes and Scouting for Girls as part of their UK tours, the band have held their own alongside a host of reputable acts! Recently they signed a licencing agreement for their debut album with Spectra Records, a USA based Indie Label and are looking to use their global reach to attract even more listeners to their music<br /><br />"¢	This and That promotions recently wrote :  "Seeing the guys live confirms it, they certainly know how to put on a good show. From start to finish they play with real style, catchy guitar riffs and drum beats you can't help but nod your head to or tap your feet. They love to play live and it shows. With plenty of gigs under their belt and a support slot with The View, the future looks really bright for Quentins Basement and they are smashing guys too. If you have not had the pleasure of seeing them yet then we suggest you check out where they are next playing and get your dancing shoes"<br /><br />"¢	After playing to representatives at M.A.S records they wrote :- "Three minute warnings from these perky purveyors of indie post rock. The QB's give you a sonic smack across the ear - especially on opening numbers 'Look What You're Doing To Me' and 'Some Things Never Change.' With ringing guitars and authentic streetsiness songwriting. This new Leeds band strip rock down to its beating heart. Essential listening" - KG - MAS Records.<br /><br />"¢	After attending one of Quentins Basements gigs, Bitter Sweet Symphonies also wrote :- "This indie four piece haling from Leeds are off-the-scale good, with soaring riffs and epic soundscapes, Quentins Basement are definitely ones to watch.<br /><br />"¢	What you can expect from Quentins Basement is a collection of fast paced, electric, indie anthems, with ridiculously catchy lyrics and smouldering vocals that you can't help but sing and dance to. Simply put, they have a sound that will never get old, just insanely good music. <br />They have only been together for four years, but they have already achieved a lot so far, having gained a solid fanbase locally and played many gigs, they are surely soon to be branching out beyond their native Yorkshire and setting their sights on the rest of the UK, which, I for one, can't wait to see.<br />Recently having supported The Strypes at the Cockpit in Leeds, the band's biggest gig yet, is surely a good sign for them that they are starting to get the recognition they deserve, it can only go up from here on out"<br /><br />"¢	After coming to a number of their gigs, VisualAudio Leeds also wrote: "With an ever-increasing stage presence and fan base, Quentin's Basement's indie rock anthems are infused with hooks that could catch a thousand fish, and will have you singing the whole way home. This band is definitely one to watch for the future." - Cal, VisualAudio<br />Their debut E.P entitled Folds has proven successful, with the song "Some things Never Change" being played once a day for a week on Yorkshire radio thanks to the "Pigeon Detectives" Matt Bowman. Matt also tweeted about the band saying that he really enjoyed listening to their dubut EP along with making them Yorkshire band of the week on his radio show. The EP has also gained the attention of Sky Sports news presenter Alex Hammond who has a copy herself!<br /><br />The future is looking promising for the band and they are looking to push on and make their mark wherever they play! Make sure to come down and watch them play live, they'll be sure to make it a top night!<br />Band Details<br />Callum Talbot - Lead Vox/Rhythm Guitar<br />Ollie Grubb - Backing Vox/Lead Guitar<br />Martyn Alderman - Bass Guitar<br />Thomas Hawran - Drums<br /><br />email: quentins_basement@hotmail.co.uk<br />Website: www.quentinsbasement.com<br />Twitter: www.twitter.com/quentbasement<br />Facebook: www.facebook.com/quentinsbasement<br />YouTube  http://www.youtube.com/quentinsbasement<br />Soundcloud: https://soundcloud.com/quentins-basement<br />Instagram: http://statigr.am/quentinsbasement.</p>
