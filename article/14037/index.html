    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for ZX Story.</p>
    <p>once upon a time in the cloud fortress paul t was having one of his nostalgia fixes playing treasure island dizzy on his trusty sinclair zx spectrum.<br /><br />after finding that elusive 30th coin behind a bush on his not elusive enough 30th birthday the music had well and truly become stuck in his head and was not going to leave.<br /><br />this gave him an idea...<br /><br />he decided to try and recreate something similar but add in his liking to punk, metal and rock and roll as well.<br /><br />a couple of hours later some basic backing tracks were created, but now paul t had a problem... he was a bit poo when it comes to playing guitar...<br /><br />so he contacted his long time friend who also has a similar liking for retro video gaming and therefore lena was recruited to add her mad guitar skills and also teach him to play better...<br /><br />after a couple of years of pissing about, changing minds, laziness on paul t's behalf, holidays, a man in a gorilla suit, the transformers/batman movies coming out and dead rising 2 followed by weekly noise making in a rehearsal studio they are now ready to unleash their noise upon you!<br /><br />now it is the beginning of a fantastic story! let us make a journey to the cave of stude... i mean... monsters...<br /><br />join us... become a part of the story....</p>
