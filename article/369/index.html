        <h1>The Glitterati - Do you love yourself?</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Do you love yourself?" recorded by The Glitterati. The review was written by Holden DeForge in 2003.</p>
    <p>Poptones is steadily building up a healthy roster of artists with a fair range of diversity. From Martin Carr's Brave Captain to Cosmic Rough Riders via The Bellrays. Alan McGee has always loved his rock and roll though so it's no surprise that he was attracted to having The Glitterati release their debut single on his label. The understated opening of "Do You Love Yourself" soon bursts into a venomous pitbull of raw rock energy, straining at the leash to attack you. Vocalist Paul Gautrey shines through, with a voice that offers control and emotion as well as it handles the way Gautrey seems intent on ripping out his vocal chords as he spits out the chorus. The dynamic rise and fall is majestic and the backing vocals that answer back the main vocal line proffer up thoughts of many a great 80's rock tune. "Heartbreaker" twins nicely with the first track to give us more of the Glitterati's classic rock sound with a modern edge, that elevates beyond "the another rather average NME endorsed band" status. Both tracks are infectious, raucous and downright sleazy. I defy you to keep your air guitar in its case! Coming along at just the right time, with the rock revival in full swing, The Glitterati may just clamber over everyone's coattails and trample over their heads.</p>
