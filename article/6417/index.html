        <h1>Nerve Engine - Red Son Rising</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Red Son Rising" recorded by Nerve Engine. The review was written by Harry Johns in 2006.</p>
    <p>Chugga Chugga Chug, cheeky twidly solo, screamy bits, nice bits. It’s a dynamic most of us have got used to since Killswitch Engaged released “Alive Or Just Breathing”, but funnily enough, this Leeds-based 5-piece have some killer songs, some wicked riffs and this whole 5-track CD just works. The cynic in me wants to address just how unoriginal most of the factors that make up Red Son Rising are, but I can’t help but get dragged into a frenzy of air-drumming and headbanging, so I’ve decided to simply leave my music-snobbery at the door.<br><br>“One Chance” is your perfect opener, fast and catchy with some nice beatdown bits, nothing too complicated but it's instantly appealing to the ear and has really cool positive-hardcore style vocals towards the end of the track. Next up is this EP's best and catchiest song, “Phoenix”. A punishing nu-metal-style opening riff leads us neatly into an amazing chorus; it’s an instantly appealing heavy-as-you-like commercial metal song, awesome. “Never See Me Fall” is a more groove-orientated affair, sticking to the mosh-tastic feel of the whole record, but leaning towards early-Fear Factory style vocal melodies in the chorus and some nice lead-breaks that hints that Nerve Engine are more than just riffs and hair. Only in “Rise” does the whole formula start to get a bit stale, and we’re left with quite dull and samey filler, but the overtly-poppy “My Own” is a really nice end to the release, with its lighter feel giving the ears a deserved break.<br><br>Overall, Nerve Engine have sculpted some polished but emotional songs that will please headbangers that prefer the big-dumb-heavy bouncings of Soulfly rather than the technical noodlings of Unearth, but also enjoy a melodic and sensitive side to their metal, too.  Great, simple metal for the pit, that not only emotes, but fucking rocks.</p>
