        <h1>Chilli - Broken Hearts</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Broken Hearts" recorded by Chilli. The review was written by Sam Saunders in 2001.</p>
    <p>Fronted by Sarah Richardson's strong vocals, Chilli have an ambitious and professional approach. This four track EP is well recorded and expertly played. The music is a gentle soft rock with fans of the Cranberries in mind. There are strong country rock and blues sections in there too, with references back to Little Feat and echoes of Bonny Rait and Texas (Scotland).<br><br>It has to be said that there are no risks and no great moments. It is a pretty anodyne package. If you are a fan of the aforementioned artists there won't be anything here to extend your listening pleasure and you shouldn't get too excited at the mention of their names.  The most likely scenario is that you see five piece Chilli somewhere local, that you have a good night enjoying their accomplished performance and then buy the CD to take home. It looks good. You might file it near to your Kiki Dee and Rod Stewart albums.</p>
