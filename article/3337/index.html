    <p>Hype Dark Productions present a night of Human Beatboxing, the art of replicating entire songs using nothing but the vocal chords.<br><bR>On the night of Thursday 25th November hundreds of music fans will gather at The Wardrobe to witness a competition like no other: music being made solely with the mouth. Eight of the country’s finest human beatboxers will battle it out to win the title, plus the £400 in prizes.<br><br>Judging the tournament are three renowned professionals: Foz, the current champion, returns as a judge after a year touring the country. Mowgli, who is reputable worldwide after his performance at the World Beatbox Convention in 2003, is coming over from York to lend his expertise. Finally Shlomo, who is back in Leeds after recording the theme tune to the 2004 Olympic Games with Icelandic superstar Björk.<bR><br>Leeds has become quite a focal point for the UK’s beatbox scene, producing several of the country’s brightest stars. Consequently the tournament, which is hosted by Orifice Vulgatron of Foreign Beggars fame, is expected to be a nationwide affair. Last year’s battle attracted participants from all over the country.<bR><bR>The prize is substantial: £400 of clothing from beatbox specialists mic(ism) and urban hemp-ware THTC, plus there will be scouts from national beatbox agency ‘AllFromTheMouth.com’ looking to sign up fresh talent.<Br><br>The night in itself is not just about beatboxing: DMC scratch champions The Flaredycats will be playing a 4-deck set, and once the battle is over the night will progress with drum n bass hosted by LSRfm.com, featuring Ruckspin and MC Drop of the Valve Soundsystem.<br><br>For more info or to enter the tournament call 0845 4049535 or email tournament@hypedarkproductions.co.uk.</p>
