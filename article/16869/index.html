        <h1>The Sailmakers to release a new single 'Remember'</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2012.</p>
    <p>Folk rock band The Sailmakers will release their latest single 'Remember' via iTunes and Spotify on Friday 24th August and will celebrate its release with a launch gig at 360 Club on Friday 17th August.<br /><br />Exclusive pre-release copies of the single will be available at the launch gig, a whole week before the official release date.<br /><br />The band have had an exciting year to date. In February this year they were picked along with 5 other artists to play as part of 360 Live in association with BBC Introducing, which was broadcast live and also streamed live on to the BBC screens in Millennium Square, Leeds and Centenary Square, Bradford. <br /><br />The band also headlined two shows in Manhattan in March, one of the shows was at the famous Alrene's Grocery.<br /><br />Ryan frontman of the band said: "We are very excited about releasing the new single 'Remember' which follows our debut EP 'Creaking Ships and Midnight Whiskey' which we have been promoting with various gigs across the north of England. It blew us away when all the CD's sold out - we were so chuffed to know people were enjoying our music, we just love writing and playing but people buying it is always exciting"<br /><br />"After the success of our debut EP launch at the 360 Club in March, we can't wait to get back on that stage on the 17th. Our live set will feature the single as well as a couple of new ones we have also been working on over the past few months. The single is stripped back and loose on the record, but how we play it live is full on heavy folk rock."<br /><br />You can also listen to The Sailmakers on BBC Introducing West Yorkshire (via Radio Leeds & the BBC iPlayer) on the 16th August.<br /><br />Regarding the launch gig, Richard from 360 Club told us, "I really like this band, lovely sounds by lovely folk and a great live show" and added "I would say their music is heavy folk with lush rhythms and playful lyrics, weaving guitars and rolling bass lines. They create warm textures and imagery with their music".</p>
