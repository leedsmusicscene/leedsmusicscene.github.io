    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2011.</p>
    <p>Our album Molehills out of Mountains is finally out. Initially it is only available via our website or from Jumbo Records and Crash Records in Leeds.  The album will get a wider release in January 2012.<br /><br />The album contains 11 brand new recordings. Two of the songs ('Constitution Failed' and 'Cry For The City') have featured in the BBC drama Waterloo Road.  Another song, 'The Waltz', won the 2 Weeks 2 Make It video competition in Sheffield in the summer of 2011.<br /><br />The album is available in three formats: CD, vinyl and download.  We are continuing with our "pay what you can" policy for the CD and download versions.  There is also a Deluxe Vinyl Bundle which includes a signed LP, a t-shirt, a set of badges, and a CD of the album.<br /><br />Our website has also had a makeover, and can still be found at www.wilfulmissing.co.uk where you can buy and listen to the album.<br /><br />Now that the album is out, we hope to be gigging more in 2011, and will be playing in Leeds as soon as we can fix up a date.</p>
