        <h1>Seas Of Furious Lizards - Untitled</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Untitled" recorded by Seas Of Furious Lizards. The review was written by Tim Hoadley in 2011.</p>
    <p>"Progressive instrumental Soundtrack" are three words to strike terror in this music reviewer's heart. Images are instantly conjured up of practice sessions involving each band member emailing samples to each other, all from their separate bedrooms. Whilst on stage, Macs and samplers far outnumber the 'proper' instruments. The only movement to then be seen during these gigs is the concentrated nodding of heads as the next loop is mixed. <br /><br />Now whilst this may well be true of Seas of Furious Lizards, (and the above comments ARE just the music snob coming out in me) this collection of demos lure and tempt me in to find out more. This will I'm afraid involve me going to see one of their gigs, if not to find out how rough these demos are, but also because I feel a further dimension will be available at a live show, that these demos don't yet give.  But the fact I want to see a sample-laden, electronic/rock act is in itself a testament to these three tracks.<br /> <br />"Stop Selling Out Your Own Species" is a melodic yet industrial beast. It reminds me of early Martin Grech. Thick, sludgy guitars, barely decipherable but perfectly timed vocal samples and killer hooks. <br /><br />If I was to be critical of this track it would be that it loses its impetus about halfway through. This track would be ideal as a shorter, 'impact' intro to an album or EP. Killed stone dead or mixed somehow into the second track. <br /><br />"April" starts life as a soundscape created by a mid-nineties Portishead, before it finds its metal feet. Completely vocal free it is the weakest, impact wise, of the three tracks. But it is no less proficient and versatile for it. "April" loops and swirls around your head with a sinister motive, before smashing you around it with aggressive percussion and crunching guitars.  The track somewhat fades into nothing towards the end, kind of limping to a halt. But granted I can't think of an alternative way I would end this instrumental. <br /><br />Final track "WMIAS" is everything "Stop Selling Out Your Own Species" is but with an extra pair of balls attached! Every Alt-Band's favourite sample, George W Bush, is on hand to provide the vocal commentary for this one, backed by a chaotic orchestra of industrial riffs and some admirable production. It is tracks like this that will get the listeners off their collective backsides and down to the gigs, myself included.  <br /><br />I suspect in these demo forms, some people (maybe even the band included) will find technical faults in the production of these songs. For me, the levels all seem fine and it all appears tight enough.  These musicians are clearly accomplished and although they heavily rely on vocal samples to create their sound, they are not afraid to let their music do the talking. In time this message will be as clear as it is loud.</p>
