    <p>Rival Sons from Long Beach, California are coming to Leeds.  They will play the O2 in Leeds on 28th March. <br /><br />The band recently performed on Later With Jools Holland, following another TV appearance in the USA on the Late Show with David Letterman and a phenomenal performance at the star-studded Classic Rock Roll of Honour awards in LA. They also fitted in a last minute support slot with Lenny Kravitz at Wembley Arena.<br /><br />With elements of psychedelia and more than a nod to soul, the new Rival Sons album 'Great Western Valkyrie' received rave reviews when it was released earlier this year. This, their fifth record in as many years saw the band yet again recording live in Nashville, using '50s gear borrowed from Sun studios, acknowledging their heritage, but always having their eyes and ears focussed on the 21st Century. The next Rival Sons single 'Good Things' is a stroll through the land of possibilities that highlights the soulful melodies of enigmatic singer Jay Buchanan, shows off the signature guitar tones of Scott Holiday, whilst the powerhouse rhythm section of Michael Miley on drums and the sultry grooves of Dave Beste on bass pin the whole song down.<br /><br />Watch Open My Eyes Official Video<br /><br /><iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/umrIUDOo-aM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
