    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2013.</p>
    <p>The Pigeon Detectives are embarking on their most honest, raw and energetic phase yet and they're looking for extras to be in the video for their new single.<br /><br />The single is from their upcoming fourth album, 'We Met At Sea', which is released via Cooking Vinyl on 29th April 2013.<br /><br />The next single is one of those tracks you'd expect from the band... it's great live! For the video, the film crew are looking to create that great live atmosphere you find at the band's gigs and who better to be in the audience than real fans themselves?<br /><br />This is a great opportunity for you to hear the song before everyone else and maybe even see yourself in the final cut of the video.<br /><br />Organisers will reveal more on the day and if you want to attend, ensure that you sign up free via Yorkshire Gig Guide as they won't be able to admit anyone that hasn't reserved a place. <br /><br />The video shoot takes place at The Wardrobe in Leeds on Monday, March 18th (5:30pm - 9pm) and only those aged 14 or above can attend.</p>
