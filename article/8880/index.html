    <p>Are you the next big thing to hit the charts? Think you could follow in the footsteps of Corinne Bailey Rae or The Music? Then you should be a part of Bright Young Things (BYT) 2008.<br><br>The best musical talent in Leeds is being asked to step forward and submit demos to the BYT project, organised by Leeds City Council’s Arts and Regeneration Unit and renowned as a successful launch pad for young artists’ careers.<br><br>Now in its second decade of success, BYT continues to equip young musicians with the tools they need to get to the top: Fifteen groups or solo artists selected by music experts will be given the opportunity to work in a recording studio and feature on a unique CD to be released in March next year.<br><br>Copies of the CD will be distributed with the Leeds Guide and hundreds of others will be sent to music industry and media contacts around the country.<br><br>Bright Young Things has also become famous for its live gigs in well-known venues throughout Leeds. These events give the musicians the chance to perform in front of a crowd of their peers, music enthusiasts and watching music professionals.<br><br>Cllr John Procter, Executive Board Member for Leisure, said, “Bright Young Things provides a wealth of unique opportunities for young bands in Leeds to develop, learn new skills and gain new experiences. Likewise it also provides people in Leeds with the chance to see the best young talent in the city perform live.”<br><br>All the artists chosen for this year’s Bright Young Things will benefit from free recording time - provided by local Leeds studios, a professional photoshoot and a track included on the BYT 2008 compilation CD which will be distributed widely, and with the Leeds Guide in March next year.<br><br>The musicians will also perform live at a high-profile gig, feature on the BYT website, gain press and media coverage and be promoted to music industry sources across the UK.<br><br>Demos should be submitted by Friday 16 November 2007 and recording will commence during December and January. All bands need to do to enter is get together a demo of original work, as well as a biography and a couple of photos, then send it in along with an application form. Those interested can get full details and downloadable application forms from the website www.leeds.gov.uk/byt.<br><br>Information and application forms can also be obtained by calling (0113) 247 6457, or by e-mailing byt@leeds.gov.uk.</p>
