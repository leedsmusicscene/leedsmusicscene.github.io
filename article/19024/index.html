    <p>Superball Music recently announced the signing of talented singer & multi-instrumentalist Charlie Barnes, for the release of his forthcoming debut album 'More Stately Mansions' on the 11th May 2015 in Europe.<br /><br />Now he is pleased to reveal a brand new video for the track 'Sing To God' which is premièring here: <br /><br /><iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jdUmctqu_Jc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br /><br />Charlie had this to say about the clip:<br /><br />"We wanted to keep it really simple for this video, we've never done a video before and some of our favourite music videos are just straight up performances. The most important part of it was to get a genuinely beautiful venue close to home, and in Leeds they don't get much more stunning than Left Bank. Using a church-turned-artspace for a video with God in the title wasn't intentional as such, but I do enjoy the fact that both the song and its video were recorded in former places of worship! Our friends Ben and Benjamin blagged us some theatre lights, and long-time van companion Ryan Pearce kindly pointed his camera at us 30 odd times while we threw ourselves around all day. It was a super intense day, but we're so pleased with how it's come out. Oh, and 50 points for anybody who can find the hidden chambered nautilus design from the album cover...!"<br /><br />Charlie has also confirmed a selection of solo and full band live dates, including three dates in Leeds: 11th April at the Fox & Newt (with band), 13th April at Oporto (solo), and the album launch on 12th May at the Brudenell Social Club Games Room (with band).<br /><br />As part of the promotion for the album, Charlie has also been asked by Leeds based coffee roastery North Star to create his own signature blend. He spent a lot of his early twenties playing solo in coffee houses around the UK and Europe, whilst working part-time making coffee back home in Leeds and it seems to have paid off. More information on that to come!</p>
