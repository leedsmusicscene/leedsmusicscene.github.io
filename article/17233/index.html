    <p>Celebrating their tenth anniversary in 2013, Wakefield band The Cribs are set to release 'Payola' - a career spanning compilation album - on 25th February 2013.<br /><br />The band have just confirmed a show as part of this year's NME Awards series of dates at London's Brixton Academy and now comes news of their new single 'Leather Jacket Love Song' to be released on 10th February. <br /><br />Having swelled to a four-piece following Johnny Marr's tenure on guitar, the track was written during the recording of the band's fourth album 'Ignore The Ignorant', has rarely been aired live, and was to become one of  the final songs completed as a four-piece and one of the band's most sought after tracks.<br /><br />'Leather Jacket Love Song' denotes the end of the four-piece and as such, acts as a conduit for subsequent endeavours having reverted back to the family trio, namely last year's heralded fifth album 'In The Belly Of The Brazen Bull' and arguably some of their best live shows ever.<br /><br />The song was recently aired on Steve Lamacq's 6Music radio show.<br /><br />As part of the release of album 'Payola', fans can also purchase a 40-track 'Anthology Edition'.
