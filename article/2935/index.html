        <h1>The Occupation - Untitled</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Untitled" recorded by The Occupation. The review was written by Richard Garnett in 2004.</p>
    <p>The Occupation roar into your speakers! With soaring post brit-pop guitars and pounding beats befitting big venues and po-going indie-rock crowds. It's an impressive sound and clearly in part due to working with local knob twiddling genius Carl Rosamond who has no doubt helped craft that "big" feel.<br><br>Three tracks of emotive and heart-felt gritty rocking indie, all filled with some superb rhythm work and intelligent guitar trickery. Unlike many The Occupation manage to make it belong rather than pile it on top for the sake of trying to make an impression. There's definitely a nu-brit rock feel with certain moments reminiscent of such current luminaries as Hope of States.<br><br>The songs themselves are perhaps just lacking the ultimate hook to truly carry them to the uninitiated. The ideas are indeed plentiful but a good dish doesn't always need every ingredient on the shelf to make it taste nice.<br><br>With this great sounding demo The Occupation have announced their intention and step confidently in to the "One's to be watched" category.</p>
