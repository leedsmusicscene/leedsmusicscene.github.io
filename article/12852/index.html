        <h1>The Declining Winter release 'official' World Cup song</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2010.</p>
    <p>Leeds post rock/electronic 6 piece have thwarted the usual independent underground convention by releasing a World Cup song, the cheekily titled 'Official World Cup Theme 2010'. The song  brings to mind New Order's classic "World In Motion" if it were married with the melancholic, orchestrated pop of Australians The Go-Betweens and is the perfect soundtrack for drowning your sorrows after that quarter final exit on penalties.<br /><br />The Declining Winter are the brainchild of Richard Adams, co-founder of Leeds indie experimental pioneers Hood (Domino Records). Adams admits that his bandmates were surprised to find out they were playing on a World Cup Song. "Most of them don't even like football, I think they were mildly horrified... but it appeals to my sense of the absurd, it's kind of the last thing anyone would expect us to do".<br /><br />The record is being released by Saltaire's Home Assembly Music usually more notable for its ambient, introspective  music. Adams: "I was going to release it on my own as a limited edition mainly for the amusement of my friends, Home Assembly got hold of it and were furious that I hadn't played it to them earlier. Again they are open minded  - there's nothing stating that a song about football can't be good".<br /><br />There is a limited CD run available direct from Home Assembly Music's website and in stores through Cargo Distribution.  The track will be available for download after June 14th. <br /><br />The Declining Winter play two shows in June to support the release:-<br /><br />June 4th Hebden Bridge, Hole In t'Wall <br />June 5th Leeds, Left Bank  <br /><br />Link to video<br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I87Xlv9yc<br /><br />Buy limited CD direct from label<br />http://www.homeassemblymusic.com/buy.php</p>
