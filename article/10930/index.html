        <h1>Lowfields - Untitled</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Untitled" recorded by Lowfields. The review was written by Jessica Thornsby in 2009.</p>
    <p>Despite only forming four months prior to this recording, Leeds act Lowfields' first ever demo is two tracks of instantly likeable mainstream rock, played by very accomplished musicians. Their guitarist in particular turns out some very polished and professional-sounding solos, and epic riffs. The guitar-led intro to 'We're Not Done Yet' is particularly stirring, and wouldn't sound out of place grafted onto the beginning of any of the rock songs currently garnering mainstream radio play. <br /><br />On demo opener 'We're Not Done Yet,' Matt Pease turns out a strong, mid-range vocal performance. However, he is guilty of forcing his voice out of its comfortable range, with audibly strained results. He plunges far too deep on the pre-chorus build up, and chases after an ill-advised high note at the end of the chorus. It's unnecessary, as he was doing just fine to begin with.<br /><br />Despite a mostly strong vocal performance on 'We're Not Done Yet,' the vocals are a definite weak point on 'A Colder Shoulder,' especially during the stripped-down verses. Why they sound so weak here, but not on 'We're Not Done Yet,' is anyone's guess, although perhaps bulking up 'A Colder Shoulder' would shift some attention away from the vocals.<br /><br />Both 'We're Not Done Yet' and 'A Colder Shoulder' conform to the same classic structure. They move from rousing and attention grabbing instrumental introductions, to sparser verses, into a dramatic and denser pre-chorus build up, and finally into a chorus of arcing guitars and sing along vocals. While it would become a little predictable if Lowfields put out an album where every guitar solo and change of tempo fell exactly where you'd expect, on these two songs, the classic structure only feeds into their instant appeal. <br /><br />Second track 'A Colder Shoulder' is the less accomplished of the two, mainly due to the verses of slightly 'off' vocals. However, that's balanced out by the immediate, sing along appeal of the choruses. "Whoa, whoa-oh-oh!" may not be the most original chorus ever penned, but it does administer a shot of easy fun. <br /><br />This is a very promising demo from talented musicians, and a songwriter who seems to have a knack for writing the sort of rock that gets bandied about the radio waves. The only thing Lowfields have to watch out for, is playing it too safe.</p>
