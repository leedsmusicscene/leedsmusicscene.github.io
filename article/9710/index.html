    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for Lost Souls (2006).</p>
    <p>Karl Johnson - Vocals / Guitar<br />Andy Ledder - Guitar / Vocals<br />Junior Wharton - Bass<br />Mark Kimberlin - Drums<br />Chris Pikard - Guitar / Vocals<br /><br />Formed from the aftermath of Yorkshire outfit Spin who had great success in 2006, when they managed to beat off fierce competition from tens of thousands of other acts to win Virgin Radio Best Unsigned Band, and picking up the ultimate prize which was 2 dates at Milton Keynes supporting Bon Jovi and Nickelback.<br /><br />Shortly after however the band split and Karl the original frontman set out to form a new line up and go in a slightly different direction, a slightly darker, slightly heaver exterior, but with commercial hooks and anthemic choruses.<br /><br />Along with new bass player Junior they set out to find the ultimate line-up. After several months and several line ups things began to take shape.<br /><br />Junior stumbled across Mark through a website, a Leeds based drummer who had just split from his band and was searching for a new challenge. The rhythm section was complete.<br /><br />Now the search was on for guitarists. After trying out several potentials without success, Chris came to the helm and provided a powerful full guitar sound with some excellent riffs. This was exactly what they were looking for.<br /><br />So then they were in search of the fifth and final element, a second guitarist. They have now completed the line up with lead/rhythm guitarist Andy..</p>
