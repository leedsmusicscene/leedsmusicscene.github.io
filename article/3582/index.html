        <h1>Spitfire Charlie - What did we do last night?</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "What did we do last night?" recorded by Spitfire Charlie. The review was written by Sam Robson in 2005.</p>
    <p>For some reason after hearing the name Spitfire Charlie bounded about I’d started picturing a bunch of Oasis-soundalikes in Parkas. How wrong I was! The title track that kicks off this EP comes across all Television, with its itchy but intricate guitars sounding like they are chasing the Zutons-cum-Plant vocals round the studio. The second track “It happens every day” is more Libertines-esq, with its shambolic rattling shanty style it wins you over and then ends before it gets annoying, which tempts me back to listen again until it is annoying. Which is good, I guess.<br><br>“Walking thru the city” is more your standard plod along rock riff, and I’m not a big fan to be honest, though the lyrical discourse is the strongest of the EP (depicting some kind of late night adventures), it just doesn’t buzz like the first two offerings. EP closer “Am I right or am I wrong” leads me to guess what the question is about; if the question is “Does this song sound a lot like Led Zeppelin? Am I right or am I wrong” then the answer is “You’re not wrong... it’s still good.”<br><br>This is a strong EP, the first two tracks are a little diluted by the following two, but the song-writing is confident enough to take the band’s efforts away from the potholes of horizontal rock-clichés. It’s a slightly raucous production which leaves it slightly underwhelming for me but that’s a personal preference; whereas others would like it as a raw and edgy recording I like the polished side of the coin.</p>
