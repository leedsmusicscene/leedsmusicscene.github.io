    <p>Black Diamond Bay have had a very interesting few months, playing sell out shows in several London venues as well as appearing on the BBC Introducing stages at Leeds and Reading festivals. Following these appearances Radio 1 playlisted their recent single 'I Dreamt We Were Bank Robbers'. It was aired on all the major shows across the week and since then the phone has been going mental at BDB HQ with a whole host of management and record companies keen to get in on the act. When you see them live it's no surprise there is a massive amount of interest in these guys.<br /> <br />Jesse BDB told us "It's been pretty mad to be honest. The amount of interest since this summer's gigs has been amazing but we're not getting carried away. You can't take on board all the pretty promises as many a great band has fallen by the wayside at this point. We're just glad people have begun to take notice of the music we make. We have met with several record, management and PR companies but have resisted the urge to make snap decisions. We want to let things take a natural course. We are now looked after by 'Safe Management' who have a phenomenal track record and get what we're about. There's real enthusiasm and passion from them so we're confident they can help us make the most of the exposure we've had so far and hopefully take the band onto the next level." <br /> <br />They were keen to return to the 360 Club who have played no small part in these recent developments and are doing so this Friday. 360 records all of its gigs and it was one such live recording of BDB's last gig at the Library that was passed by promoter Richard on to BBC Introducing West Yorkshire. Alan Raw liked what he heard and put the band on at Leeds and Reading leading to the Radio 1 airplay.<br /><br />'Little Pool's of Ice'  video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRlDMtnpA-8&feature=related</p>
