    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for LITTLEgiants.</p>
    <p>LITTLEgiants' music is a unique blend of old time, blues, country, bluegrass, rockabilly and just about anything as long as it's raw, and passionate. They were formed by husband and wife Martin and Ruth Nuttall following the break up of their previous band Five Corners, with a view to playing and writing music that encompassed all their influences and at the same time keeping it simple and accessible.<br /><br />Things really started to happen when Morley Hilton joined the couple on upright bass, they met by accident over a 50's Ford pick-up truck and haven't looked back since. With the final addition of Andy Greaves (who Martin plays with in the Tragics) on the devil's mandolin and guitar, the line up was complete and armed with a set of new songs, some original, some traditional, LITTLEgiants' raw old time sound went public.<br /><br />They have played recent supports to the likes of Emily Barker & Red Clay Halo, Ten Bears and Rook & the Ravens.<br /><br />Incorporating banjo, guitar, harmonica, accordion, slap bass and mandolin, they bring a new twist to traditional sounds.<br /><br />Their debut recording, the 5 track EP "Welcome to our House" was recorded by the band 'live' around a single microphone with no over dubs or fancy stuff to give an honest representation of the band's front room sound..</p>
