    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2006.</p>
    <p>The increasingly popular bandfest, Quidrophenia 3, is returning to rock the foundations of Oporto this August bank holiday, Monday 28th August with yet another impressive line-up.<bR><bR>With 20 big names from the Leeds music scene including Jack Afro, The Bazaars, Hot Dead Fox and The Isles, Quidrophenia 3 is set to be bigger and better than its predecessors and organisers are hoping to attract music lovers from far and wide to celebrate the best local music talent.<bR><bR>The charity event, which charges just £1 entry free, hence the name, with all proceeds going to Cancer Research, raised £650 for Cancer Research back in May, £100 more than the inaugural event last December and Oporto are hoping to top that total once again.<bR><bR>Organiser Marko Crossley, lead singer in Leeds’ band Jack Afro, commented, “What started out as an idea to bring together Leeds bands under one roof has snowballed and has attracted some great bands, great crowds and also great publicity for Leeds music. There’s some amazing talent in Leeds and this is just a great way of showcasing it.”<bR><bR>Manager of Oporto, Paul Lane, added, “Oporto has always been renowned for its great music policy and by hosting Quidrophenia and our Monday Night Live band events has allowed us to go one step further and become a great live music venue too. We’ve raised some good money for Cancer Research at the last two events but we’re hoping to go way beyond that figure this time round.”<bR><bR>The15 hour music event, from 12pm until 3am, will see a total of 15 bands and five acoustic acts take to the stage throughout the day and night.<bR><bR>Quidrophenia came to fruition when Marko decided to create an event where Leeds bands could all get together and perform under one roof, uniting the spirit of Leeds music. While appealing to those ensconced on the Leeds music scene, holding Quidrophenia at Oporto, rather than one of the obvious, larger music venues, meant it would also promote Leeds music to a broader public which raises more awareness of Leeds bands.<bR><bR>Fifty advance tickets are available from Oporto at £5 each, guaranteeing you entry and allowing you to come and go as many times during the day as you please without paying again. Ask bar staff for details.</p>
