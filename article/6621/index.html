    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for Practical Headz.</p>
    <p>Huddersfield's finest crew Practical Headz comprises of the Bishop, Fingaz, Spida Lee, and the Practical Hand. This impressive debut album features 'Reality' with thugged up mid 90s flava co production from the Beat Butcha and backing vocals from a local tramp who popped into the studio to ask for some special brew, Other bangers include 'Get The F**k Out' with some humorous lyrics from Spida Lee about suspicious odours and not being able to get into clubs. On 'Throw Ya Handz Up' the Headz collaborate with Tony Bear on some intense up tempo chopped up production while 'Stop The Diction' witnesses the Bishop rock over a dark synthed up beat. Then there's the downright sinister epic 'Shit Spitters' Oh my! The release is solid, there's bair more goodness coming from them so they're definitely peeps to check for in the future.<br />
<br />
Practical Headz drop this album via Timeless Music Project (linked to Chocolate Fireguard) which promotes West Yorkshire music. The Headz also feature on label compilation 'Interesting Flavours' CD with the very soulful 'Smooth Vibe' and they have gigged with label mates French hip hop unit LA Cedille, Mary-Jane and Kava Kava as well as Skinny Man, Excalibah (BBC 1xtra) and Chocolate Fireguard's Timeless Festival event - alongside Jehst, Lo Fidelity Allstars, Iration Steppas, Asaviour, DJ IQ, Fat City, Freestylers, DJ Vadim's Oneself etc.<br />
<br />
Reactions to debut 'Who Iz It?'<br />
<br />
MOJO :  "The people's republic of West Yorkshire has not figured strongly on rap's radar, but Practical Headz, three Huddersfield hip hoppers who take as much pride in their real accents as Mike Skinner does in his adopted Cockney, are ready to right this considerable wrong. Crucially, the music - from Stop The Diction's sci-fi scowl to The Get The F**k Out's synth bass bounce - its the raps' equal." <br />
<br />
Daddy G 'Massive Attack: 'These guys are great. 'Get the F***k Out' should be the next single. Really good'<br />
<br />
DMC Update: 'Top Trumps in every sense of the phrase' <br />
<br />
Undercover: 'Straight up electro heavy hardcore peppered with relishably regional rudeness' <br />
<br />
Beathut:  'Gutsy British hip hop from Huddersfield that retains a gritty urban reality to its tough tales and rudery, accompanied by tight production and a sprinkling of dark humour' <br />
<br />
Fmagazine : 'Its refreshing to witness a hip hop crew making moves outside London and the trio's distinct twangs nicely spice up the British rap game' <br />
<br />
Independent On Sunday: 'A four piece rap group coming at you straight outta Huddersfield, Practical Headz spit their foulmouthed lyrics in a surprisingly affecting Yorkshire-via-the-West Indies patois, and prove that good British "urban" music doesn't necessarily just originate within the M25. Grim housing-estate narratives jostle with cheeky battle rhymes, smart similes and puerile teenage smut, all delivered with an unaffected insouciance that's hard to dislike. Grubby electro and grinding hardcore club beats provide the bedrock for an attention- seeking but accomplished debut'.</p>
