They also played with Suede and The Lilac Time.<br /><br />The band decorated their stage set with trees based on those found in the children's TV show  "The Magic Roundabout" - hence the name of the bands live followers "The Toytown Architects".

The only album the band made for Arista was Cresta released in 1990. The band split up in 1991.<br /><br />The album Twisted made up from unreleased, demo and live tracks was released in the US only on November Records in 1994.<br /><br />After David left, new band Buzz Aldrin were formed but didn't last long.
