        <h1>Leeds Music Scene: a round up of 2009 as we look forward to 2010</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2010.</p>
    <p>With 2010 just a week old, here at Leeds Music Scene we've put our heads together as a team and come with both our predictions and recommendations for who to watch in 2010.<br /><br />We've also taken a look back at 2009 with a short retrospective of some of the highlights of the year on the Leeds music calendar.<br /><br />Between the team the Leeds Music Scene writers have come up with a varied mix of established, well-recognised and new bands to keep your eyes on this year.<br /><br />The team voted Wild Beasts as their favourite album of 2009 (with 'Two Dancers') and are continuing to watch the band's progress closely in 2010. <br /><br />About Wild Beasts, our new Interview Editor Kathryn Holden wrote that they "are just so unashamedly sexy and confident and experimental that they've managed to produce one of the albums of the year"; Live Reviews Editor Steve Elvidge accurately predicted they would be a "shoo-in for best album"; and Sean Gavan said that the October 2009 gig at the Cockpit featuring Wild Beasts and Blue Roses was his "gig of the year".<br /><br />So it comes with little surprise that Wild Beasts have taken the Leeds Music Scene Writers honour for "Band Of 2009" and remain on our writers' radars for the coming year.<br /><br />Runners up in the Leeds Music Scene poll were Grammatics and Sky Larkin, who both released cracking albums during 2009. Sky Larkin released their debut album 'The Golden Spike' in February of 2009 via the Wichita Recordings label, and the Grammatics album was not only special in its own right but it also marked the 50th release by local label Dance To The Radio.<br /><br />Other local recommendations for 2010 nominated by the team were Dinosaur Pile-up, Volcanoes, Chickenhawk, Wonderswan, Sketches, Lunchtime Disco Club, Fieldhead, Katriona Gilmore and Jamie Roberts and Arthur Rigby & The Baskervylles. <br /><br />Dinosaur Pile-up's appearance at the Cockpit was nominated for Best Live Gig last year, and their Summer Hit Single was also listed as Best Track. A worthy nominee. <br /><br />It was Live At Leeds 2009 that topped the poll for the Best Live Gig, and there is little doubt that the event will be up there again in May 2010. Don't miss out!<br /><br />Closely following was Leeds Festival 2009, with Radiohead's headline appearance at Bramham Park leading the way for a few of our team. Leeds 2010 will of course bring the media attention to Leeds again this summary - watch out for the announcements in March.<br /><br />Away from Leeds, the team have recommended a host of bands (some old, some new). In no particular order: Brand New, Health, Grizzly Bear, Speech Debelle, Future Of The Left, Frightened Rabbit, The Temper Trap, Married to the Sea, Daisy Dares You, The XX, Passion Pit and Marina & the Diamonds are tipped to "ride the Florence bandwagon" in 2010.<br /><br />From a website perspective, a special mention comes in for writer Thomas Keighley who provided over 50% of the local band coverage in the live reviews section in 2009 and Jessica Thornsby who contributed over 100 CD Reviews. Thanks Thomas and Jessica!<br /><br />That completes our short review of 2009 and a glimpse into 2010. As always, Leeds is a creative hotbed and there is lots of amazing music being written and played across the city - far more than an article here could do justice.<br /><br />We know we've missed out a lot, so please do leave your own thoughts on what made 2009 special for you and who we should look out for in 2010.</p>
