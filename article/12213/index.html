    <p>Leeds musician Paul Thomas Saunders will be launching his début EP 'Four Songs In Twilight' on 5th February 2010. <br /><br />With influences such as Joe Meek and Leonard Cohen, Paul Thomas Saunders fashions his own brand of alternative song that is poignantly intimate yet majestically arranged.<br /><br />His EP was recorded over four nights in his Leeds basement and encompasses both his love for far-out production and good old-fashioned song writing.<br /><br />Following an enthusiastic reception and a UK support tour with Blue Roses, Paul Thomas Saunders has a string of releases and dates lined up for 2010. He is featured on the new Dance to the Radio compilation 4x12" Volume 4 and was recently played on Lauren Laverne's 6Music show.</p>
