    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for The Hypes.</p>
    <p>The Hypes are an upcoming band based in Leeds. Thriving from influences such as Oasis, The Beatles, The Who, Stone Roses and Arctic Monkeys. They have created a  distinctive Rock 'n' Roll sound which always brings a satisfied appreciation from all they play to including acts they support. Having gained more new fans along the way it was inevitable a northern stroll has taken them to perform in some of the most noted & popular venues, in & around cities of Leeds & Manchester. With demand now claiming their arrival this should take them further afield, ventures have pinned them down to other areas with strong music scenes.<br />The band have an EP out called '7 Years Of Change' which you can check out on their myspace.<br /><br />''Finally today 'The Hypes' brought their distinctive brand of rock 'n' roll to the crowd. They also brought a great following. Anthemic songs were delivered well by each band member. They seem to be improving by the day. Watch out England'' <br />Yrock - review<br /><br />''Leeds lads 'The Hypes' have formed themselves into a solid gimmick free guitar band in the 21 months they have been playing together. They opened with a building number and the set continued with tune after tune of melodic Indie-Rock. Forceful drums and quirky tempo changes drove the rare sounds you could nod your head and shake your hips to.'' <br />Surface Unsigned semi final - review.</p>
