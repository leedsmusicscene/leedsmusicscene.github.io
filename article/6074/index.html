        <h1>Chickenhawk - Untitled</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Untitled" recorded by Chickenhawk. The review was written by Simon Glacken in 2005.</p>
    <p>Ok well put simply Chickenhawk are a tad demented. Demented is good. I like that and I quite like Chickenhawk. Clearly though when you sound like the bastard child of Mr Bungle and Slayer you’re not going to appeal to everyone. Again when one of you songs (Piglosaur) features no lyrics but instead some bloke screaming erratically you’re clearly not going to win over the mass majority. But that’s the appeal. This band could not give a flying piglosaur what people think, ok well maybe a little since they sent in a CD, but really they just seem to love to make chaos. Chaos is good.<br><bR>“Dr Fellatio” is a raging behemoth of a song, which is superbly heavy and is a wonderful mess of noise and heavy riffs while the odd lyric appears now and then amid the occasional yelps. Fans of anything related to Mike Patton will be more than happy with what’s on offer.<br><bR>Final track “Kerosene” has actual lyrics, no really, you can even make them out as the band sound like they are going to spontaneously combust while playing crunching riffs and bass lines to a backdrop of random squeals and noises. Crazy, stupid stuff made by a crazy stupid band. Wonderful.</p>
