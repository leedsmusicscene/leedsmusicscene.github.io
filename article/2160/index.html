    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for Vib Gyor.</p>
    <p>Vib Gyor were a Leeds based Indie band (2004 -2009)<br /><br />Frustrated with everyday life, the Leeds-based band formed in 2004 through the Leeds Music Scene website. Industry recognition and public acclaim followed a breathtaking performance at Manchester's In The City music convention & the following year they played much-coveted slots at Glastonbury's 'Late n Live' and Leftfield Stages.<br /><br />Vib Gyor released their only album 'We Are Not An Island'on May 25th 2009 as an exclusive download with iTunes USA. After some preliminary sessions at the infamous Rockfield studios with Ken Thomas (Hope of the States, Sigur Ros,) the band were keen to imprint their own distinct sound to the recordings, and regrouped at their studio in Yorkshire to record and produce the album with band member Zane Keenan at the helm. Having secured 'single of the week' with iTunes for their track Fallen, the band did a West Coast tour of the USA to coincide with the release.<br /><br />We are not an Island was the follow up to The Secret EP, recorded by Paul Corkett (Muse, Radiohead, The Cure....) at his Studios in Bath. It recieved airplay in the UK (BBC6 Music, XFM Single of the Week & Virgin Extreme). In the USA the band were  tipped as 'most likely to succeed' by Britsound and lead single 'The Secret' caused a stir with plays on Indie 103, KRNK and WEQX. <br /><br />Their debut single "Fallen" was produced by Mike Cave at Liverpool's Parr Street Studios, and was released to critical acclaim on both sides of the Atlantic. There was a phenomenal response stateside, including regular airplay on KROQ (Jed the Fish-Catch of the Day!), KNRK, WEQX, Indie 103 and an interview and acoustic session on San Diego station 91Xs The Big Break, a slot usually reserved for US talent. In the UK, Fallen received regional & national airplay including Zane Lowe at Radio 1, Phil Jupitus and Tom Robinson at BBC6 music & XFM; who playlisted the track in Manchester, Scotland and London.<br /><br />Singer Dave & drummer Jonny are now working together in a new band called The Fossil Collective & Zane is currently working on an (as yet) untitled solo project.</p>
