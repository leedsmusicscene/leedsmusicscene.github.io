        <h1>Envoys release new album on PledgeMusic</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2016.</p>
    <p>The Leeds post-rock / metal act Envoys have announced that their second album, Bliss, will be released on May 3rd 2016 through PledgeMusic. The record features nine new songs which, in their own words, have been more challenging - and more fulfilling - than anything the band have worked on before.<br /><br />Envoys formed in early 2011 and have since played extensively around Yorkshire as well as touring the UK and Europe.Their debut album, Violescent, was released to critical acclaim in 2013 resulting in shows with the likes of Nordic Giants, Tides From Nebula, Cleft and performances at StrangeForms Festival in both 2014 and 2015.<br /><br />The unusual and thought-provoking album artwork is a graphite illustration by local artist Rachael Elwell, who has created the perfect aesthetic for the sound and themes of the record. The band also called upon local musicians to provide cellos, violins and extra voices on the album which have added new dimensions to their sound and created nine well-crafted songs, truly born of Yorkshire.<br /><br />The recording process was entirely self-funded and self-produced, and this led Envoys to the decision to release the album through PledgeMusic with exlusive bundles of LPs, CDs, T-shirts and the Bliss artwork available to pre-order, along with some exclusive one-offs.<br /><br />You can pre-order the album and purchase those exclusive bundles via http://www.pledgemusic.com/projects/envoysbliss</p>
