        <h1>And None Of Them Knew They Were Robots - ANOTKTWR</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "ANOTKTWR" recorded by And None Of Them Knew They Were Robots. The review was written by Dave Sugden in 2001.</p>
    <p>It's always a surprise when something you happen to pick up because of the attraction of the band's name alone, turns out to be rather good.  I've been on the lookout for recorded material from this Leeds-based four-piece since I saw their name on gig listings and here it is, a self-titled seven-track mini-album on Pigdog Records.<br><br>If you're after the rock album that delivers everything, then this may well be it; contained within the seven tracks is a sound that ranges from the underlying emo-rock basis to a more hook-forming rhythmic indie-rock statement.  Couple this with a wide-ranging vocal style, including the occasional screaming outburst and you find yourself listening to a post hardcore record that meanders around many rock influences.<br><br>The whole CD runs in at half an hour, yet it's the penultimate track "An Equation" - registering just a minute and a half - that wins due credit for being so great and short at the same time, a true blast of guitars combined into an explosive, energetic emotional sound.  A great record. </p>
