    <p>The final names for the prestigious Indie50 have just been announced, and Leeds' Nathan Clark, owner of the Brudenell Social Club, is among them.<br /><br />The inaugural Indie50 is a new award celebrating some of the most influential, unsung heroes of independent live music in the UK.  Following an open, public nomination phase earlier in the year, the Award's judging panel, including BBC 6 Music's Tom Ravenscroft and Pitchfork's Laura Snapes, deliberated the final 50, turning out a diverse selection, covering the many corners of the live landscape today.<br /><br />Also announced is the Indie50 photographic exhibition, launching on 1st September with an evening private view, and running until the 8th September at 71a Gallery in London.  Commissioned to shoot each of the Indie50 within their natural habitat, lauded music snapper Dan Wilton travelled from Totnes to Glasgow, Margate to Manchester, Liverpool to Leeds to capture this vital, if disparate, group of pros and passionate behind-the-scene-ers.  Previously turning in work for the likes of James Blake, Dizzee Rascal, Caribou and Stormzy, Dan's images were all shot on 35mm film, giving the striking collection a raw aesthetic and energy in line with the subject matter.</p>
