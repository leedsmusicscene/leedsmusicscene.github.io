    <p class="lead">This is a review of "s/t" recorded by The Cut. The review was written by Richard Garnett in 2004.</p>
    <p>If there is such a thing as Funk-lite then surely Huddersfield 3-piece The Cut would be at the top of the list. This 3-song set is in-offensive, cleanly executed and smoothly performed like a watered down Jamiraqui without the drugs, drink or sex appeal.<br><br>The fact Huddersfield is clearly in upstate California judging by the Ammerrreeecaan twang adopted across the vocals quickly begins to grate. Opener "Pour Your Love" offers crowd pleasing tactics in its breakdown singalong. "Way I'm feeling" is stacked with irony protesting as it does that England is crying out for a new song... being the weakest on offer it's unlikely to meet its own call. The best here is the Duran Duran closer "Another one falls down" with its chant... pause... chant... pause... chorus and spacy guitar demonstrating the bands potential to break the mould of the earlier cuts.<br><br>The Cut are sewing the right seeds but need to sharpen things up. Ambition is one thing but invention is another and for now the Funk world isn't crying out for a set of slimming products.</p>
