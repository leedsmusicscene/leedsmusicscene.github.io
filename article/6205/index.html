    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Ciara Star" recorded by Unfinished Drawings. The review was written by Richard Garnett in 2006.</p>
    <p>This young Leeds 3 piece offer a piano-led soft-rock set on this their second EP. But don’t be fooled, this is no Keane and nor is it as purported in the biog “the softer moments of bands such as Biffy Clyro, Straylight Run and Feeder” which is in itself a bizarre enough concept for a band’s sonic aspirations. Instead the overly fussy piano that wanders up and down too many notes, the faux American accent and the plain nasty synth strings that fill out the background make this sound more like Jamie Cullum performing Marillion and Nickleback ballads. If after that you are feeling quite nauseous, bare in mind that this was surely never the band's intention and they have plenty of time left in their careers to rectify it. As with so many, playing their instruments isn’t the problem and with some simpler arrangements, catchier melodies and “less is more” philosophy applied all round, the future will look brighter.</p>
