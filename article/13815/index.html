    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for Backyards.</p>
    <p>Our songs are big but intimate, intense but heartfelt. Our debut EP 'If You're Scared' was released 1 Feb 12 and our new single 'Goodhart's Law' is now available on all major online stores. The music video for 'Goodhart's Law' can be seen here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnGWVuW3nyg<br /><br />----------<br /><br />"It's a truly magnificent record.... How it is legal to subject someone to this level of excitement compressed into a 17 minute EP is beyond me." - Joe Scrase, Leeds Music Scene<br /><br />"I've seen comparisons made with the likes of Arcade Fire and Radiohead, and whilst Backyards clearly draw inspiration from many quarters, they have a sound which deserves to be judged on its own merit. A collection of beautifully written and immaculately produced songs, which easily make Backyards the most exciting new band I've heard from Leeds in a long time." - Rob Aldam, Counterfeit Magazine<br /><br />"It's a rare and tender moment when a band come together in perfect harmony, blending imagination and innovation to perform an enthralling set of songs that all work perfectly alongside each other in a pristine balance...The Anglo/American vocal duo took turns to showcase their abilities, huge, cinematic vocals rang out around the room, proving that when playing live, the band are a force to be reckoned with. Not to mention possessing an intense modesty that suited the band's naturally intelligent posture." - Benjamin Maney, Leeds Music Scene.</p>
