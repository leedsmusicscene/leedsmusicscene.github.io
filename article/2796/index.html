    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for Wet Paint.</p>
    <p>Punk rock four piece, Wet Paint formed on 10th December 2001. Wet Paint are Luke Frank Parker (guitar / vocals), Charlie Smallwood (bass), Sean Ryan Shackleton (drums) and Sam Carlisle (guitar).<br><br>When Luke returned from a long holiday in Canada, he was itching to start a band again, and Charlie, was also looking to turn just a bit of a hobby into something more worthwile so they teamed up and presuaded Sean, who was getting fed up of trimming the bushes, to join as well. Sam was recruited 3 months later to complete the lineup.<br><Br>Our influences vary from heavy rock like Rage Against the Machine and System of a Down right through to bands like The Beatles. We like to think our influence is as varied and versataile as our style. we regularly swap instruments to accommodate each others preferences and abilities and each member of the band has written at least two songs on their own but the majority of stuff comes from everyone's contributions.<br><Br>We have so far been well recieved at numerous local venues such as the 1in12 Club in Bradford and Parkside Social Club in Haworth but we are more renowned for our gig at the GuideFest, Hainworth last August where we co-organised the event and played to a packed out crowd who raised over Â£1300 for charity (a second is confirmed for 17th july this year).<br><br>Wet Paint have also played at the Cavern Club, Liverpool and hope to play more nationwide gigs in the near future.<br><br>The band are to release their debut EP on 26th June this year..</p>
