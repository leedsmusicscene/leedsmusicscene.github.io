    </div>
    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2015.</p>
    <p>Some of the nation's most successful music industry leaders will be coming to Leeds on Sunday 6th September to speak at Music HubTalks, a brand new conference that is geared towards music industry professionals in the North. <br /><br />Music HubTalks is hosted by start-up Creative Industry Hub, in partnership with JTV Digital, and will take place at the Met Hotel.<br /><br />The event is being held to inspire music industry professionals and inform them of the latest trends and insights as well as giving them the opportunity to network with other industry professionals. <br /><br />The speakers include Jason Perry (Grammy-winning international songwriter and producer/lead singer of the rock band 'A'), who will be returning home to speak on his 20 years of music industry. Other speakers include Paul Conroy (former president of BMG Chrysalis Records and Virgin Records), Jon Skinner (CEO of Music Gateway), Laura Westcott (CEO of Soundcheque) and Pete Downton (CCO of 7Digital), to speak on a wide variety of subjects.<br /><br />Eiger Studios will be sponsoring and exhibiting at the event, alongside Horus Music, the global music distribution company; SX Pro, a pro audio retailer based near London; and Laniakea Music, the artist-focussed YouTube Multi-Channel Network.<br /><br />George Taylor, the Founder and Director of Creative Industry Hub, moved to Leeds from London in July 2014. He previously set up 'Strictly Go Networking' in London and hopes to replicate his previous success on a larger scale with HubTalks events for Music, Fashion, Film and Art professionals in the North and the South.<br /><br />Speaker Jon Skinner, CEO of Music Gateway, said "Even with Music Gateway's global demographic, we still see a lot of activity from our UK users from the North. I'm really looking forward to taking part in the panel and re-engaging with this area of the industry."<br /><br />If you are a music professional and you'd like to get a ticket for Music HubTalks in Leeds on the 6th September, or find out more about how Creative Industry Hub can support your career or business, visit creativeindustryhub.co.uk/events/music-hubtalks-september-2015/.</p>
