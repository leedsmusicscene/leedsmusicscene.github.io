    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Black And White Films" recorded by The Rosie Taylor Project. The review was written by Alexander Rennie in 2007.</p>
    <p>It would be easy enough to dismiss 'Black And White Films' after a cursory listen.  Boasting a gently plucked guitar line that trundles along for four minutes without really deviating, and lacking anything that could really lay claim to being a 'chorus', it's a tune that can pass you by as lightly and unobtrusively as a gentle breeze.  Basically folks, the Pigeon Detectives this ain't - but then this sort of music can appeal to an altogether different part of our psyche than those rowdy boys and their ilk.<br><br>It's quite satisfying in its own way, featuring some charming boy / girl vocals and a little bit of wistful trumpet thrown in for good measure.  It's not going to be everybody's cup of tea but, hey, what is.  It's just something that rewards a little bit more concentration from the listener.  And the same can be said of 'Maps For Lost Lovers', which certainly compensates for the A-side's lack of refrain.  It also puts the boy / girl thing to better use with some proper counterpoint harmony, rather than sticking to simple delivery in unison throughout.<br><br>In summary, if this is going to rock you then it will do so gently.  It's definitely a disc for retiring to the armchair with a glass of wine rather than repairing to the dancefloor with a bottle of beer.  So if that sounds to you like an endorsement then grab a copy and crack open a bottle ASAP.  If, however, it sounds far more like damnation with faint praise then I'd definitely suggest you save your cash.</p>
