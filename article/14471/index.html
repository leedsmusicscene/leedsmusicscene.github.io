    <p>Live At Leeds organisers have announced that they be hosting their very successful Unconference again in 2011.<br /><br />The Live at Leeds Unconference is organised in partnership with Leeds Metropolitan University and Leeds University Union and last year is was heavily oversubscribed. <br /><br />Organisers this year are increasing the capacity with a move to Leeds University Union and are able to offer a full day of music industry discussion and inspiration for up to 300 guests.<br /><br />The day will feature panel discussions, industry talks, creative workshops and performances from the national and local music industry; focusing on themes such as press exposure, music production and the live arena.<br /><br />The advice panel returns to help bands with that next step. To have your track played and discussed at the panel session and to be able to ask the panel your questions just send your myspace/bandcamp/soundcloud link and some info on the band to the email below (no files please).<br /><br />The conference is free to attend, you just need to register to guarantee entry. Send your name to unconference [ at ] liveatleeds.com.<br /><br />Any spare places will be allocated on a first come first served basis on the day. <br /><br />Live At Leeds Unconference takes places on Friday 29th April, 10am to 6pm, in the Leeds University Union.</p>
