    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for four day Hombre.</p>
    <p>four day Hombre are:<br><br>Simon Wainwright - vocals, guitar, piano<br>Rich Huxley - vocals, guitar<br>Ed Waring - keyboards<br>Jason Miller - bass<br>'Ash' Ashwell - drums<br><br>four day Hombre entered the then quiet Leeds music scene circa 1999 with just one innocent declaration: The music they produce and all that surrounds it must be honest. With little inspiration from fellow unsigned bands or the charts but a shared love of artists like The Frames, Spiritualized, Johnny Cash, Guns IM' Roses, Beach Boys, dEUS, and Neil Diamond, they began to produce songs bursting with melodies and vocal harmonies to die for and lyrics so genuine and heartfelt they instantly connect. Musically they are the quietest and most gentle band on earth. That is until they decide to show you their other side, where they instantly become the angriest and loudest band you are ever likely to hear. Damien Rice dancing with the devil; in a good way.<br><br>Their first demo was recorded. Hints of longevity and great songwriting were evident, gaining glowing reviews, as well as fans feeling a real resonance with the songs which reeled them in even further. It sold out. four day Hombre began to build a reputation for their energetic live shows and being one of the hardest working bands around. They released a live EP. It sold out. Playing hundreds of gigs to new audiences, supporting the likes of The Coral, Snow Patrol, The Hiss, And You Will Know Us By The Trail Of Dead, Four Day Hombre developed a new confidence both on and off stage. They have an edge to their live shows, that magic ingredient X which makes you stand and stare, a quality most bands may never achieve.<br><br>In late 2002 the band self-recorded a 3-track demo which was to be the catalyst of National radio frenzy. A few months later in early 2003, the demo originally sent to Steve Lamacq finds itself selected to go on the Onemusic Unsigned playlist and subsequently finds itself on the Radio 1 daytime playlist. As a direct result, they signed a Single deal with Crystal Songs. Things were beginning to move very quickly.<br><br>In July 2003 their debut single 'First Word is the Hardest' received Radio One airplay again, once more on daytime shows as well as the evening session. With limited press coverage, but mass radio support, it charted at number 80, culminating in a live appearance on the Chris Moyles Show. The single sold out. This is the band that submitted that very same recording as a demo six months previously. A pattern seems to be emerging.<br><br>Since then the band have been busy writing with recent influences coming from Elbow, Tindersticks, Aereogramme and Damien Rice amongst others; continuing to play live, recording, building their own studio and gearing up for the independent release of their second self-recorded single, Mr. M (Alamo Music). A difficult task lies ahead of four day Hombre. They must now select just a handful of songs from their ample catalogue to be included on their debut album to be recorded later this year..</p>
