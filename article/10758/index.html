    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for Claire Cameron Band.</p>
    <p>Continuing the energetic Leeds tradition the band write and perform original, passionate, emotive songs with their signature mix of styles. <br /><br />'Time Will Tell' is the new release from Claire Cameron Band, marking the growth of the group into writing collectively and creating music as a fully fledged unit. With a raw storytelling narrative the album straddles the Gothic and singer songwriter genres, with nods to the metal musical sphere punctuating the music with powerful moments of light and dark. The band recorded with Neil Sadler, whose credits include working at Maison Rouge (Jethro Tull) with Laura Marling on her early recordings, and the acclaimed Blues Rock Guitarist Larry Miller, at No Machine Studios.<br /><br />The new release had its first airing on BBC Radio Leeds with Alan Raw on BBC West Yorkshire Introducing, and on the same evening Michelle Dalgety from Yorkshire Music Collective interviewed the band and played the CD on her radio show on BCB radio.  Claire was interviewed by The Music Fix to mark the release and The Star ran a competition to win signed copies of the CD.  After a successful London launch party at 100 Club,Claire Cameron Band supported Carina Round at The Well, with fellow Leeds band Sawsound and finished off a storming year with a headline set at The Pit n Pendulum, Nottingham before going back into rehearsals ready for a 2013 New Year Tour!<br /><br />Claire has also recently made a guest appearance on The Idol Dead 's new album 'Dark Little Hearts' and she performed live at the album launch at 360 Club - Leeds Music Scene said of her guest spot 'My personal highlight of their set was a softer ballad type track titled 'I'm Drowning' in which the band invited guest vocalist, the talented Claire Cameron onto the stage.'<br /><br />Press<br /><br />'There is a somewhat epic nature of the Claire Cameron Band's compositions....Claire and her bandmates add layers of guitars, vocals, and keys - all with a distinctly symphonic-metal quality - to the softly woven tapestry of dreamy pop that lies at the heart of Claire's vocal style and melodies. The five songs making up 'Time Will Tell' - 'Love Of You', 'Spinning Tops', 'Black Albatross', 'Question Every Day', and 'Exposition' - form a cohesive whole, almost as if this were a concept record or the musical component of a larger performance piece.'  The Impaler Speaks on Time Will Tell<br /><br />'If you've seen them live then you'll already know how great they are but for those not afforded the pleasure well, you're in for a treat. Lush complex arrangements that mix up indie/rock/pop influences into a hook-laden, well crafted 7 tracker. Add to that Claire's heavenly vocals and you've got a winner for sure.' Jumbo Records on 'Time Will Tell'<br /><br />'Cameron's beautiful, haunting, candid vocals that travel on dreamlike keyboard parts simply demand to be heard.' A Musical Priority<br /><br />'With influences ranging from Beyonce to Led Zeppelin, there is most definitely something for everyone in Claire Cameron Band's music, and I suggest if they are playing a gig near you, you go and check them out!' Chelle's Rock Blog<br /><br />'More than just a rock group, more a way of life..' Borin Van Loon<br /><br />'The music of Claire Cameron Band takes a cross section of almost every genre imaginable and flits between them in a surprisingly cohesive manner' No Title Magazine.</p>
