    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for Girls Cant Dance.</p>
    <p>Girls Can't Dance are a Leeds based band but with roots all over the UK. Kier, Paul, Olly and Joe, 4 students brought together by their love for music and lack of funds, blend gritty guitar, energetic bass and beats, and melodic vocal hooks to create a brand of music that captures the frenetic energy of Leeds crossed with the innate cry for hedonism that pulses through the youth of today.<br /><br />The boy's relatively short lifespan has been exciting. Starting out as a five piece under former name Bad White People in January 07, they were signed to a one track distribution deal by local independent label, Medicinal Records, after their first gig, having a 3 track single sold on CDBaby. BWP built up a reputation by doing house parties in a city that houses over 80,000 students.<br /><br />After gigging regularly at venues in Leeds such as Joseph's Well, Santiago's and The Cardigan Arms, the band unfortunately parted ways with Mike, one of the guitarists, in May07. A decision was made to make a fresh start, but with barely a week before a gig supporting Lady Fortune at The Brudenell Social Club in Hyde Park, time was against them. The boys pulled it out of the bag though, and after a 48 hour jamming session fervently trying to re-craft and re-record their sound, Girls Can't Dance was born. They performed at The Brudenell the next day, fully ready with a four track CD to give away, and it went down perfectly.<br /><br />It was then that they decided to take this show on the road. Now managed by North London venue, Nambucca, they have since played venues such as the Camden Barfly, Hi-Fi in Leeds, Manchester Academy 2, Fibbers, Soho Revue Bar. There are a growing number of high quality venues being added to that list. The lads are willing to open, headline, busk and beg to get their music heard and get anybody in the vicinity dancing like nobody is watching. Bands they have played with include Rum Shebeen, Hatcham Social, Jay Jay Pistolet, WinterKids, Rosalita, Vinyl Collide, Grandeur Rat, Trafalgar and The SneakyPeeks to name a few.<br /><br />The Burley Road Sessions E.P. is available as a freebie at every gig, and with lots of sweat/blood/cuppas/spliffs currently being spent/smoked recording new tracks, an impressive second E.P is en route and will be available in the very near future.. So come dance with us...! x.</p>
