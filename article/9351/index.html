    <p>Huddersfield's award winning social enterprise Timeless Music Project has just returned from France where it has launched the breakthrough new music development initiative ‘Independent Sounds Of Yorkshire And The Humber 2008’.<br><br>This year the featured artists and beneficiaries are: The Rosie Taylor Project, Asaviour & DJ IQ, Rosie Doonan, Vib Gyor, Supadark, Skint And Demoralised, Ultramegasupadeadly, Andreya Triana, Martyn Strange, The Colonel, Haggis Horns, Mr Beasley, Darlings Of The Splitscreen, The Huskies, Far From The Dance, Lyn Acton (with Pearls Cab Ride), Ben Elliot and The Landaus.<br><br>The various musical styles are well represented from rock to pop, from drum n bass to country through to indie, acoustic and dance genres, picked from all corners of the region.<br><br>Every year the international music industry flocks to the MIDEM Music Conference in Cannes. For over 40 years MIDEM has provided delegates with unique networking and business opportunities and there has always been a very large British Music Industry presence at Europe's largest Music Conference.<br><br>This year Timeless Music Project (Examiner Community Awards Winner 2005) sourced 17 up and coming acts from the Yorkshire and the Humber region and promoted them to top industry movers and shakers.<br><br>Copies of ‘Independent Sounds Of Yorkshire And The Humber 2008’ will also be promoted at the highly influential SXSW Music Conference, Austin, Texas where the CD will be included in the official SXSW British Music Industry goodie bags at the main showcase BBQ event.<br><br>With the area's profile perhaps more under the spotlight now than ever before, largely due to the regional success stories of major label acts like Corrine Bailey Rae, Kaiser Chiefs and Arctic Monkeys, the 17 track Showcase CD is designed to draw attention to the region's diverse and thriving independent music sector.<br><br>TMP grew out of Huddersfield's successful local 3 stage community music event Timeless Festival and has been profiling local music for over five years. This latest project follows on from other promotions at the SXSW Conference in Texas in 2006 and 2007 where the Social Enterprise showcased Bradford unsigned talent and West Yorkshire based Independent records labels to great success.</p>
