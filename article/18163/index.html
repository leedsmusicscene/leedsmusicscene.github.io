    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for Rachael Hannah Mccaul.</p>
    <p>So take a pinch of soul, add a drop of acoustic blues, a touch of Northern spice and finally add some gritty rock and roll and mix it all together. Rachael Hannah Mccaul combines these influences into a simple and raw sound for you to hear. So sit, back listen and enjoy the music! <br /><br />Rachael began her singing career in 2009 while studying Drama at Queen Mary, University of London. She has not looked back since and continues to write, play and sing her own material. <br /><br />Performing in venues across London and Leeds including Monto Water Rats, The Library, Stratford Theatre, The Verve and The Fenton amongst many other venues and music events has allowed her to explore, understand and work in the tough world of the music industry. <br /><br />In November 2012, upon returning to Leeds, she has also joined a band called Secrets of Kaplan who are going to strength to strength and have given her the taste of performing in a band.<br /><br />Yet Rachael continues to produce her own material and songs and is hoping that her soon to be released EP will really show the strength, power and silkiness to her vocals. <br /><br />So sit back, close your eyes and be transported back to the old school soul of R'n'B, simply singing from your heart, till your heart is content..</p>
