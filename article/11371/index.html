    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for Johnny Powell.</p>
    <p>During 2009, Johnny Powell began the creation of a large and unusual collection of alternative folk material for his new solo project using the harp, acoustic guitar, vocals and electronics as the major instruments (www.johnnypowell.com).<br /><br />The songs also involve a variety of strange and unexpected recorded clips and the use of unusual, yet meaningful objects (e.g. curtain rails, toy cars, high heels, graveyard noises etc.) all designed to have symbolic links to the lyrics, and add intentional atmosphere to the music.<br /><br />Fans of Sparklehorse, Bright Eyes, Joanna Newsom, Devendra Banhart, Leonard Cohen, Will Oldham, Bjork, Radiohead and The Books could be interested.<br /><br />To date, the project has included collaborations with electronica maestro, Oliver Charles (Cookbook Records), and fellow Dharma bums, Sam Leeming (additional guitar, mandolin and electronics) and Chris Derrick (piano on music and poems, and clarinet). It is rumoured that 2010 will mark the emergence of live sets with a variety of collaborators.<br /><br />Those interested in original artwork, new songs, lo-fi recordings, rambling musical experiments, clippings of poetry and other matter can visit his official web-site (www.johnnypowell.com).<br /><br />Aside from being a solo artist, Johnny also performs regularly as singer, songwriter and guitarist for UK-based 7-piece alternative folk act 'The Dharma Bums' who have performed regularly at venues and festivals and have had several releases over the last few years, most notably the progressive folk album 'Watching The Dark Move' (2008) - (www.myspace.com/thedharmabumsfolk).<br /><br />The band have also written an original soundtrack to the cult classic silent movie 'Broken Blossoms' and have performed this live to cinema screenings on a number of occasions, funded and promoted by various arts bodies..</p>
