    <p>Jumbo Records are delighted to welcome Nightmares On Wax in store this Saturday, 9th November, for a very special intimate DJ set. <br /><br />George Eveyln is the creative force behind Nightmares on Wax and responsible for some of the defining moments within dance music of the 90's.  He is also credited as a founding member of trip-hop and tacit instigator in the explosion of the chill-out genre, following the release of the seminal Smokers Delight in 1995, a genre that is still going strong today. <br /><br />George was also responsible (alongside Richard Watson - 360 club) for bringing underground artists such as Afrika Bambaataa, DJ Shadow, Cold Cut, Kid Koala and Roni Size to the fore, through the legendary Leeds club nights Funky Mule & Headz Club which began in '92. <br /> <br />So come and spend your Saturday afternoon soaking up some lovely vibes with a real legend.  We can't think of many better ways to spend your day, so if you don't want to miss out, get yourself there! DJ set starts at 1pm.  <br /><br />Available in store on the day, will be the Nightmares On Wax back catalogue at a very reasonable price and the new album will also be on offer.  Following the DJ set George Eveyln will be available for signing those all important purchases.  <br /><br /><iframe width="420" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/T2JjObJY_ZM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
