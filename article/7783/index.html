        <h1>Piskie Sits debut album "The Secret Sickliness" to be released in the New Year</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2006.</p>
    <p>Wakefield-based band Piskie Sits have announced the release of the band's début album on the Wrath Records label. Available for pre-order now the 11-track CD is titled “The Secret Sickliness” and includes the band's 2006 début single “What Is The Point?”<br><br>Piskie Sits' racket is fuelled by a love of US slacker noisenik pioneers of the 80s and 90s (Pavement, Sonic Youth, Dinosaur JR, Sebadoh, Breeders), their Scottish equivalents (Jesus & Mary Chain, Teenage Fanclub, Vaselines) and classic English pop artists such as Bowie and Blur. Add swaggering, Northern bravado and a healthy dose of good-time absurdity and you may come close to understanding Piskie Sits' outlook.<br><br>Since their formation in late 2004, the last two years have seen Piskie Sits' popularity increase. Following an appearance in the Wrath Records “Super Sevens” Singles Club, the band were invited by BBC Radio One's Huw Stephens to record a session for the “OneMusic” show. Two singles later and the five-piece were invited back to the BBC to record another session, this time for Marc Riley's “Brain Surgery” show on 6 Music.<br><br>Piskie Sits have scheduled two launch parties in the West Yorkshire region. On 27th January the band will appear at the Packhorse venue in Leeds, and two days later (29th January) the band will make a hometown appearance at Escobar.</p>
