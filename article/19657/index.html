    <p>Cara Hammond and Lauren Rycroft are two talented young ladies who have come together to launch their respective EPs at the 360 Club Leeds on Thursday. <br /><br />Lauren is currently making an impact with her unique combination of achingly beautiful guitar and dark and honest lyrics.  Cara's personal experiences have enabled an EP overflowing with soulful harmonies, heartfelt lyrics.  Supported by the intoxicating and melodic indie-folk music of Joseph Jones and the soaring operatic, emotionally charged vocals of Lynsey Cawthra, this will be a very special night.  <br /><br />Leeds based singer-songwriter Lauren Rycroft has picked the 360 Club, to launch her debut EP - Tide of the Mind, which will be available on the evening, ahead of the digital release on the 7th through  all the major online distributors.  The Leeds show is part of an EP launch tour which includes dates in Nottingham's, Leeds and Lincoln.   <br /><br />2016 has been a year of growth, seeing Lauren play small town stages, to headlining her own shows in London and appearances at numerous festivals around the country.  More recently, she has joined the Coffee House Sessions family with the likes of Izzy Bizu and gained the support of BBC introducing, playing a live session and was chosen as artist of the week, receiving airplay nationally.  The rest of the year looks just as exciting for Lauren as she is already booked up for supports slots until the end of the year with the likes of Newton Faulkner and Janet Devlin.<br /><br />Watch Laurens's debut music video for "Paint the Skies" here:<br /><br /><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/odbiqkA2-lQ" frame-border="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br /><br />Also based in Leeds, singer-songwriter Cara Hammond is releasing her third EP which is full of soulful harmonies, catchy melodies and retro vibes in combination with heartfelt lyrics. The inspiration for Cara's 6 track EP came from her own experiences with love, relationships and the media, which she has cleverly moulded into a universally understood message through her music. The EP will be available via all major download and streaming sites following the Launch night.<br /><br />Cara said "I think my sound has evolved a lot since my first EP in 2012 and I really love it! The creativity of Leeds and its people has definitely influenced my new music. This EP has music that you can dance to, cry to and sing along to, and I definitely did all 3 in the creation of it!" <br /><br />Watch the video for 'Addictive' by Cara Hammond here:<br /><br /><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dM_t_syTmuo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br /><br />Event Details: <br />360 Club - The Lending Room @ The Library //229 Woodhouse Lane, Leeds, West Yorkshire LS2 3AP // Doors 8pm // 18+ event // Â£5 advance tickets from Jumbo and Crash Records</p>
