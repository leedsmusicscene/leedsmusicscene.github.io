    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2012.</p>
    <p>Owners of The Well in Leeds have last night issued a statement that the live music venue will be closing at the end of December 2012.<br /><br />The reason for its closure are that the property owners have decided to "revoke the right to use any part of the property as a concert room or for live music".<br /><br />The statement went on to thank its new management:<br /><br />"We would just like to take this time to thank everyone who is involved with The Well starting with Simon & Sharon Colgan who took over the venue back in March to refurbish & rebuild its reputation to where is now. Anyone who has been in the The Well over the last few months will have seen the improvements like the fantastic new stage, PA system, bar refurbishment and everything else they've worked so hard to put in place."<br /><br />You can read the full statement here.<br /><br />Please leave your comments on the dedicated thread on Leeds Music Forum.<br /><br />Tickets for remaining shows can still be bought, check out the list at Leeds Gig Tickets.</p>
