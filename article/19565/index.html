        <h1>Daniel Pearson releases new single "4th July"</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2016.</p>
    <p>Leeds singer-songwriter Daniel Pearson has released his new single "4th July" today (Friday 17th June). The immediately infectious track (hot on the heels of his acclaimed 2015 Alone, Together album) is a freewheeling slice of his songwriting talents that welds driving guitars, Johnny n' June Cash vocal harmonies & raucous harmonica into an ironic tale of love gone sour that fizzes by in under three minutes.<br /><br />Daniel has released three albums to widespread critical acclaim around the world. Writers for Uncut Magazine, R2 Magazine, The Daily Mirror, Drowned In Sound, No Depression, Americana UK, PopMatters, Baeble Music & many more have been quick to praise timeless songwriting that fuses poetic lyrics to classic country & rock dynamics. His songs have been aired by influential DJs on BBC Radio 2, BBC 6Music, BBC Introducing, KROQ, Lightning 100, Amazing Radio, Triple J, Double J & more. TV has also made use of his emotive vocals & melodies, with his songs soundtracking hit shows in the UK. With albums praised for their lyrical skill & willingness to incorporate garage rock, blues, folk and gospel influences into his core country sound, 4th July offers a more direct example of Pearson's ability to craft nagging pop melodies within a story of betrayal & independence between two lovers.<br /><br />In addition to winning over media tastemakers, Daniel has also been a word-of-mouth success story online with thousands of fans regularly sharing his songs on Twitter, YouTube, Soundcloud & Spotify. This loyal fanbase has powered him to 20,000 iTunes downloads, over 300,000 streams & successful solo tours of the USA & UK.<br /><br />Listen to 4th July on Spotify and Apple Music & iTunes.<br /><br /><iframe width="100%" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/265829669&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true"></iframe></p>
