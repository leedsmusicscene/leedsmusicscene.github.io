    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for Last Night's TV.</p>
    <p>Leeds/Derby-based indie-folk trio Last Night's TV (Spencer Bayles, Sarah Jones and Natalie Long) proudly present a new single for Christmas, No Tinsel On The Town Hall. For the recording, the band supplemented their usual guitar/violin/glockenpiel instrument base with a 25-piece choir, enlisted from friends, family, acquaintances and Facebook followers. Telling the tale of a disillusioned couple meeting at Christmas, it starts with just a glockenspiel, ending with a mass of multitracked voices.<br /><br />The single follows the late-summer release of the band's latest album, Everyone Here Was A Stranger. Recorded between summer '08 and April '10, alongside eight songs written by Spence, it also features Natalie's 'Here Again' and Sarah's instrumental interlude, 'A Small Diversion'. <br /><br />An initial theme for the songs concerned itself with the people populating a fictional community, including the neighbours rallying round after a tragedy ('Everyone Here Was A Stranger'), the paranoid man building an underground shelter to protect against an imagined enemy ('Old Suspicions/New Suspicions'), and the concerned relatives of an elderly spinster ('Susannah, It's Not Worth It').<br /><br />In addition, a couple of songs were inspired by newspaper obituary columns. 'Dear Arabella' references the death of Arabella Churchill - grand-daughter of Winston - who died in December 2007 on the very same day her son was jailed in Australia for his part in a multi-million-pound drug racket. A little more light-hearted, 'Frank' tells the tale of Frank Blackmore, the inventor of the mini-roundabout. Details from his obituary have been exaggerated a little, but it told of how Frank, obsessed with road layouts, would go on holiday with his family but end up taking more pictures of junctions and road signs than of his kids. When his first roundabouts were implemented (in Peterborough, 1969), he'd stand in the middle with a megaphone, directing people on how to navigate their way around it. A true unsung hero (literally, until now).<br /><br />Everyone Here Was A Stranger is the band's fifth self-released album, and follows their previous releases Too Much In Doubt (2002), Daylight Between The Blades (2003), Letters Without Envelopes (2005) and Local Knowledge (2007). A collection of some of the first four albums' finer moments, Nice To Have A History: A Last Night's TV Collection was released in 2009 while the band were in a 3-year hibernation.<br /><br />Highlights from LNTV's career to date include involvement in Leeds Council's Bright Young Things project, and winning a covers competition ran by Dermot O'Leary's BBC show Re:covered with a straight-faced re-interpretation of The Offspring's 'Why Don't You Get A Job'. A planned 2002 gig in New York had to be cancelled when Spence was rushed to hospital to have his appendix removed a couple of days before the flight; not wanting to do anything by halves, it broke the Guinness World Record for Largest Appendix Removed. Alas, the record has since been broken again..</p>
