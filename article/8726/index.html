    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "43" recorded by The Debuts. The review was written by Nick Rowan in 2007.</p>
    <p>Having recently received the Futuresound nod of approval, Halifax’s The Debuts are on the up and up. These two tracks, their first shot at recorded material, display a nuanced indie-pop sound that is well-balanced if (understandably) a little raw.<br><br>It’s pretty obvious that they do possess the necessary talent to succeed, including (but not limited to) Sam Marns’ rock-solid drumwork, some sharp guitar hooks and Zandra Kleivens’ voice. There’s a slacker feel to her vocals, sort of a half-mumbled, half-sung delivery, although thankfully nothing that sounds too measured or stylised.<br><br>‘Get Set Go’ is the keeper. Driven along at the beginning by drums and guitar, the chorus has a subtle change of tempo which is nicely offset by handclaps. Kleivens briefly assumes control over the dominant guitars; “Oh don’t you know? / I think you do / I know you better than you’ll ever know me”.<br><br>With a date at the Leeds festival unsigned stage on the horizon and positive reviews following them around like a shadow it looks as if these kids will be alright.</p>
