    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for Glasshouse Roxx.</p>
    <p>The band were formed in the spring of 2005 by guitarist Luke Smithson drawing on the talent in the local rock scene. He enlisted the services of PK Kelly (Bass) and Kim Hudson (Guitar), both of whom had been co-conspirators in past projects. He then added close friend and talented drummer Chris Caulfield to the line up. The four set about working on ideas and creating a strong rock sound. The music was working well and there was just one piece of the jigsaw missing – a front man with the voice, talent and all round Rock Élan to deliver the goods. A brief period of identifying potential poaching targets proved fruitless, but in early summer the same year bassist PK Kelly saw an advert for a flamboyant rock front man looking for a band. It didn’t take long to realise that Drew Davies was the perfect addition to an already formidable line up. His enthusiasm was apparent immediately and backed by his voice and presence they knew they had found their man. The band then set about working on ideas and writing new material from hard rock to slidey blues to a more mellow acoustic sound. A few gigs and studio visits later they were still in need of a name. Many ideas had been thrown about but it wasn’t until after an autumn gig at The White Room in Hull that the debate finally ended and they agreed on Glasshouse Roxx. Voila!.</p>
