    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for Alaska.</p>
    <p>ALASKA hail from Leeds and create high energy, B-movie-inspired psychedelic garage rock with a surf-pop twist. <br /><br />Nick John Henry sings songs about the darker side of the human condition and likes reverb. Brendan Campbell has been known to drum entire sets one-handed. Dave Fisher plays bass and invented a headset at university that makes you fall asleep. Guitarist Matt Humphreys was born in the Year of the Snake...<br /><br />Telling tall tales of egg-stealing reptiles, werewolf women, drowned cowboys and prodigiously gifted skateboarders, ALASKA's current roster of songs was written when thinking about the vast, sparsely populated wilderness of their namesake.<br /><br />"Our name represents a surreal blank canvas onto which the songs are projected," says Nick. "It doesn't dictate the setting of the songs - it's meant to conjure up a feeling of isolated beauty that maybe hangs in the listener's subconscious as they hear them."<br /><br />ALASKA released their self-titled debut E.P. in January 2012, and have been confirmed to play Green Man Festival, in Wales, from August 17-19.<br /><br />Keen to collaborate with friends and local creative talent, a limited edition CD release features exclusive artwork by Leeds graphic designer Simon Walker, lovingly screen-printed by Dots Printhaus. It comes with a free Jordan Ramoth comic strip inspired by the song 'Werewolf Women In Tow', while a video for 'Girl' was directed by Stuart Ramsay, of Shady Lane Films.<br /><br />As equally in awe of The Kinks and The Smiths as they are of Talking Heads, Nirvana or Dylan, musically ALASKA is very much a transatlantic affair in the vein of Teenage Fanclub, Thin Lizzy or the Velvet Underground.<br /><br />Nonetheless, the band's dream job is to be the skeleton staff of a small town police department in the icy wilds of North America where nothing much ever happens. But when it does, it makes for one hell of a strange story...<br /><br />The ALASKA E.P. is available to download now from Bandcamp.<br /><br />NORTH, TO THE FUTURE!.</p>
