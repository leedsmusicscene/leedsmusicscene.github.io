        <h1>The Cribs announce new single 'Come On, Be A No-One'</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2012.</p>
    <p>Having whetted the appetite with 'Chi-Town' [listen here], a whirlwind four date live excursion and the imminence of a fifth album 'In The Belly Of The Brazen Bull', Yorkshire band The Cribs are pleased to announce the arrival of a brand new single, 'Come On, Be A No-One', on 16th April via Wichita Records.<br /><br />Taken from their forthcoming album 'Come On, Be A No-One' has already proven to be a new highlight in the band's ever expansive live set and sees The Cribs, who have reverted back to their trio status, in bullish form.<br /><br />The recording of this new album saw the band split their time between the UK at London's Abbey Road, Chicago at Steve Albini's EAR studio, and upstate New York at Dave Fridmann's Tarbox Road studio which is where 'Come On, Be a No-One' was born.<br /><br />'Come On, Be A No-One' is the rallying call before being enveloped by a wave of guitar, bass and drums that shows no let up in during its two minutes and thirty eight second lifetime and again sees the band return with an undiluted enthusiam and a lust for new peaks. <br /><br />'Come On, Be A No-One' is available on 7" vinyl and as a digital download through all usual outlets.<br /><br />Photo credit: Steve Gullick.</p>
