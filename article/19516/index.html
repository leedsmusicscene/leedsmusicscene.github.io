    <p>Some things just never go out of fashion. Like English summer days, Friday nights out and your favourite album on vinyl, The Indigo Project bring big riffs and cracking choruses to each of their infectious indie rock tunes and never forget that a great song can be as timeless and powerful as anything else.<br /><br />Since forming in early 2015, the young five-piece have been tearing up venues around their hometown of Leeds and painting the town purple at every gig. Following in the footsteps of major influences like Arctic Monkeys, Foo Fighters, Oasis, Muse and The Beatles, the boys' love of loud guitars and memorable melodies has impressed both local audiences and other bands on the scene. They've supported fellow rising stars Raglans and Fizzy Blood, and have also won over music lovers at the Garforth Arts and Tadcaster Festivals. New tour dates are planned for early 2016 and more festival appearances are sure to follow in the summer.<br /><br />Radio has also been quick to spot their talents, with the band gaining airplay on Alan Raw's prestigious BBC Introducing show and performing energetic live sessions for East Leeds FM. The band have recently recorded a new four track EP with celebrated Leeds producer Ed Heaton that will be released in February. The lead single 'Taste It' is a breathless illustration of their talents - all chiming riffs, pounding drums and singalong melodies. Another new EP track 'Wiseman' showcases a heavier side to the band with a stomping groove, raucous guitars and Joe Spink's Lennon-esque vocals.<br /><br />With the release of this new EP on the horizon and the band picking up new fans wherever they play, 2016 looks set to be the year that indie fans around the country get their first taste of The Indigo Project and fall in love with a great new rock n' roll band..</p>
