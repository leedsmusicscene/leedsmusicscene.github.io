    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for Ceiling Demons.</p>
    <p>Ceiling Demons are an alternative hip hop trio from Yorkshire. The group first came together in 2011 to pay tribute to a lost friend, a theme that has permeated the music ever since.<br /><br />Taking influence from The Streets' Mike Skinner and the production of DJ Shadow, Ceiling Demons seek to capture the rawness of human emotion in rhythms & rhymes. The group is comprised of identical twin brother MCs Psy Ceiling and Dan Demon, with production from Beat Demon. <br /><br />The group's first release, The Ceiling Demons EP in December 2012, was met with positive reviews, with Invasion Mag declaring it 'the only evidence we need to know that Ceiling Demons are going to have a resounding influence on the hip-hop scene'.<br /><br />Having spent a year playing shows and recording in the heart of the Yorkshire Dales, Ceiling Demons released their debut album in December, 2013, entitled Dual Sides. With juxtaposed themes of escapism, desperation and unity, it is a concept piece that aims to confront the human condition. EARMILK described it as 'music that stresses talent and creativity', and The Yorkshire Evening Post heralded it as 'an astonishingly assured debut album'. <br /><br />'It's great to hear hip hop with sincerity again' - Arrested Development <br /><br />'The album is a breath of fresh air' 8.5/10 Paul Scott-Bates - Louder Than War<br /><br />'Amazingly powerful & heartfelt' - Tom Robinson BBC 6 Music<br /><br />'Confident, unique and a much needed wake up call for mainstream British artists.' - Rhubarb Bomb <br /><br />'I'm looking forward to hearing more from them' - Scroobius Pip XFM<br /><br />'Metaphor-laden flows, philosophical taunts and subtly-spit musings all frazzling around a frame of ill-beats and samples' - Jumbo Records<br /><br />'Heartfelt and dark, the lyrics are filled with some serious reflections on the nature of loss and life and their sound has eclectic undertones of indie, metal and chillout, all wrapped up in some delicious production.' - The Crack.</p>
