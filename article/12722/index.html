        <h1>Broohaha - EP</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "EP" recorded by Broohaha. The review was written by Mark Shahid in 2010.</p>
    <p>I have seen Broohaha live on a few occasions and have observed some noticeable line-up changes, sometimes featuring a shouty-shouty-man sometimes not featuring a shouty-shouty-man, and sometimes with more brass than other times. Their first EP thankfully keeps it all at a constant as it flows seamlessly between experimental grunge-jazz through to something which should have "new wave" in the title. <br /><br />On the first listen, you will sit and wait for a lead vocalist who never appears. Live, you won't. And I don't really know why that is. It could be because Broohaha in a live setting is a different experience altogether. You have to see the chemistry and, indeed, maths for yourself. The way in which they interact with one other by dipping in and out of passages and phrases whilst smiling at one another in that "oh-yes-that's-what-we-were-supposed-to-do" kinda way. The kind of thing you used to see in old smoky jazz clubs.<br /><br />As for their EP [simply titled "EP"] samples from films (I think) repeat pointlessly over sections throughout the CD, but somehow without distracting you from the tactful ventures with rhythm and dynamics, ebbing and flowing almost like each song is a few different one crunched together. They effortlessly swoon from funk bass to grunge chords in just a minute, then to some smooth, sultry-sax and then off to moody some "nng-nng-nng" ugly-sax. Everything here tastes like a cocktail of chocolate and soap. No, it doesn't make sense, but it's not supposed to.<br /><br />I'll be honest, it's not the perfect record, they need to spend more time on tuning, intonation and production, but as demo it shows just how talented they are as musicians and as a collective. So mission accomplished, I guess. Broohana really are a great existence and minus a shouty-shouty-man here and there, they're a relief and a joy to have in Leeds. Please go see them live. Please.</p>
