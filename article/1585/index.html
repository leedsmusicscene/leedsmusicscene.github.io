    <p>Malibu Stacey round off a whirlwind first year in existence with the release of their debut album and a Leeds gig at Royal Park Cellars! The band, featuring ex-Terrorvision bassist Leigh Marklew and Leafeater mainman Kes Loy, recorded their debut album, appropriately titled ON HEAT, during the long, hot summer and it is now available at all the gigs or by visiting their website. A distribution deal to put the CD into record stores is hoped to be completed in the New Year.<br><br>And their 53rd gig since their debut at Joseph's Well back in March sees them return to Leeds to blast the year out in style at Royal Park Cellars on Friday 19th December. They'll be supported by Hooker-Bentley and Electric Mud Generator. Doors at 8pm. Tickets Â£4 as usual.</p>
