        <h1>'Not Coming Down' EP launch announced by Matt Belmont</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2012.</p>
    <p>I'm happy to announce that I've FINALLY completed my debut EP. After no less than ten months of waiting and working and waiting and working we finished the final mixes in mid January and are now just awaiting the artwork so we can send the thing to be pressed.<br /><br />So... I have a date and a venue for the launch. This is going to be on February 25th at The Library pub (upstairs venue) in Leeds. I've also confirmed two of three support acts. After doors open at 7pm the night will be kicking off at 7.30pm with an acoustic set from former Chateau Berber front man Ross Millar, Followed by a set from Leeds newcomer and LCM student Natalie Holmes. The third support is yet to be confirmed but I'll be sure to inform you when they are.<br /><br />I'd love to see as many Leeds faces there as possible as this city has been kind to me over the past couple of years, so put it in your diaries!<br /><br />Matt.</p>
