        <h1>Heads We Dance - The Human Touch</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "The Human Touch" recorded by Heads We Dance. The review was written by Jessica Thornsby in 2008.</p>
    <p>'The Human Touch' by Heads We Dance is five minutes of industrial-tinged electro with futuristic synths and robotic noises aplenty, and a modest amount of addictive beats. However, in this genre, repetition is the name of the game, and 'The Human Touch' doesn't have enough hooks to keep its looped samples interesting. 'The Human Touch' also occupies an awkward halfway point, lacking that driving dance beat that would fill out club dance floors, and always falling just a few distorted synths short of being a trippy, electro head-bender.<br /><br />The frequent 'comedown' interludes are Ibiza-chillout-by-numbers, with the obligatory echoey piano and heartbeat sound effects.<br /><br />B-side 'You Are Never Alone With Model 21' takes the space-aged electro of 'The Human Touch' and shoehorns in a catchy pop chorus that gives this song some serious appeal. This is laid over a cheesy, old school disco beat that's guaranteed to stick in your head for days. However, again it's difficult to fathom what effect Heads We Dance were aiming for with the neither-here-nor-there electro backing track: it's too subtle to be a dancefloor-filler, and it's slightly too lively to be a chillout anthem. The sparse synths are occasionally bulked up with atmospheric, celestial-sounding synths, which see 'You Are Never Alone...' edge towards becoming pleasantly heady electro. However, it never quite makes the commitment and always drifts back to light-electro territory.<br /><br />For the most part, this two track disc doesn't seem sure of how it wants to sound and, in the end, it fails to make a definite impression because of this. It's catchy enough, but its awkwardly middle-of-the-road sound works against it.</p>
