    <p>Evile are: Matt Drake - Rhythm Guitar/Vocals<br />Ol Drake - Lead Guitar<br />Joel Graham - Bass<br />Ben Carter - Drums<br /><br />Evile are a Thrash Metal outfit from Huddersfield, West Yorkshire in the UK.<br /><br />Founded by old school friends Matt Drake and Ben Carter, and after playing<br />with different guitarists and bass players for a year or so, Matt's brother<br />Ol was asked to join as lead guitarist. After a short search for a bass<br />player The 3 were contacted by Mike Alexander via an ad in a local guitar<br />shop, and the band was formed. With every member contributing to every<br />aspect of the band they have a uniqueness and strength which gives them a<br />cutting edge, influenced by bands such as Sepultura, Exodus, Metallica,<br />Annihilator and Slayer to name but a few, Evile have created something that<br />the metal world is crying out for. Despite being un-signed at the time,<br />Evile were hand-picked to headline the second stage of Bloodstock Open Air<br />06, and also to open the main stage of Manchester's own Damnation Festival.<br /><br />In October of 2006 Evile signed to the legendary Earache Records, label home<br />of such Metal legends as Morbid Angel, Napalm Death, Municipal Waste and<br />Carcass.<br /><br />Evile would go on to record their debut "Enter the Grave" in Copenhagen's<br />Sweet Silence Studios with Flemming Rasmussen of Metallica fame at the helm.<br /><br />Kerrang! dubbed Evile to be "Carrying the genre's whole 'revival' on their<br />shoulders", with other positive reviews from press such as Metal Hammer,<br />Terrorizer, Zero Tolerance and Classic Rock Magazine. Metal Hammer also<br />included Evile in their second "Get in the Ring" competition, which saw 4<br />bands battle it out in a boxing ring. Evile would go on to win the<br />competition aired on Rockworld.TV.<br /><br />Aswell as supporting and touring with bands such as Machine Head, Sabbat and<br />Sanctity, the band went on to be main support to Megadeth on their European<br />"Tour of Duty" in Feb/Mar of 2008, being warmly greeted by the crowd. The<br />band also went on to support legendary Thrashers Exodus on their 2008<br />European Tour in April which in the same month saw Evile's "Thrasher"<br />included on Xbox360/PS3 videogame Rockband.<br /><br />A 2008 tour with Satyricon was cut drastically short when Ol, due to health<br />problems, collapsed breaking his jaw and cutting open his chin. His beard is<br />said to have saved him.<br /><br />Headlining the UK, and several European Festivals in 2009 would mark the end<br />of touring for "Enter the Grave".<br /><br />The second chapter in Evile's history comes by the name "Infected Nations",<br />produced by Russ Russell (Napalm Death, Dimmu Borgir), original artwork by<br />Michael Whelan (Sepultura, Obituary, Stephen King) and released via Earache<br />Records worldwide. "Infected Nations" is Evile's modern take on Thrash<br />Metal, and finds the band coming into a sound of their own.<br /><br />"Infected Nations² went into the top 100 album chart in the UK after its<br />release on Sept 21 2009. Evile played a release show on 25th Sept 09 at<br />Islington¹s Bar Academy and then embarked on a 2 month long European tour<br />supporting Amon Amarth with Entombed. After playing 2 headline shows in<br />Germany they reached Scandinavia and disaster struck when Mike Alexander<br />(1977-2009) bassist of Evile collapsed in Lulea Sweden and tragically died<br />on his way to hospital from a pulmonary embolism. He was 32 years old.<br /><br />Evile organised special tribute shows to Mike in Leeds and London in<br />December 09 and a special raffle and auction where many bands donated items<br />to raise money including Iron Maiden, Metallica, Machine Head<br />The band announced they were going to continue. Auditions were held and<br />Evile subsequently welcomed new member Joel Graham into the fold to<br />permanently take on the bass duties.<br /><br />January and February 2010 see Evile embark on on a Europe-wide tour with<br />Warbringer. Then  March they leave for their first tour of the States in<br />March on the Hordes Of Chaos II Tour w/ KREATOR, VOIVOD, NACHTMYSTIUM and<br />LAZARUS A.D. Evile then continue in April on Killfest USA Tour w/ OVERKILL,<br />VADER, GOD DETHRONED, WARBRINGER and WOE OF TYRANTS.</p>
