        <h1>Ciaran Hafferty - Untitled</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Untitled" recorded by Ciaran Hafferty. The review was written by Richard Garnett in 2004.</p>
    <p>Three songs of pleasant strumming and little distinction from this Leeds based singer songwriter. All the songs show an ear for melody and are definitely in the Evan Dando bracket, track 2 "Love Burns" could easily be lifted from The Lemonheads' "Shame About Ray" era. But the big problem all three tracks suffer from is that classic songwriter faux pas: if something's worth repeating then repeat it again and again and again and... you get the picture. There is no worse exponent of this than opener "What do you say to me?" where we pretty clearly get the message that what the person in question does actually say is "I'll be your baby" and whoops we have a song over 5 minutes.<br><br>There's little to offend but little to catch the imagination. To move on from pleasant sounding bedroom ditties Mr Hafferty may need some co-writing experience and to canvas his crowd as to whether they've got the message at 3 minutes rather than 10.</p>
