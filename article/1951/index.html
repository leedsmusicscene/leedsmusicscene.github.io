    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for The Cribs.</p>
    <p>The Cribs are brothers:<br><br>Gary Jarman - bass<br>Ryan Jarman - guitar<br>Ross Jarman - drums<br><br>As Christmas descended upon 2003, a cock sure triumvirate emerged blinking out of the mist that engulfed their native homeland ... The Cribs, armed with nothing less than 100% confidence, and an armful of songs partnered with a more than healthy disdain of most of the music being made by their contemporaries, hit the road running.<br><br>The band crisscrossed the ubiquitous small town tour itinerary ... several times, before hitching up with Wichita Recordings to quench their thirst - sometimes more than literally, as anyone who witnessed early shows can verify. The Cribs polarised opinion, those who loved them did so with reverence bordering on infatuation, whilst others simply thought, "this year's new band" and waited for the trip.<br><br>Early on in the life of The Cribs, the band made lightning strikes on the capital with hotly anticipated live shows, as well as being part of the original guerrilla gig set although, as Gary Crib notes, "We did those gigs purely because it seemed a natural progression form our scheduled shows, we weren't getting paid much for playing and we'd turn up and play somewhere for free and get fed and watered."<br><br>The band were an important part of that burgeoning scene alongside the likes of The Libertines, Razorlight and The Others, before it all imploded and shit hit the proverbial fan.<br><br>Pundits and punters alike clasped the band to their heart and hi-fis and were rewarded with the release of the band's debut album - the rather niftily titled The Cribs - which saw the Wakefield trio impart their own take on Britain's early noughties fascination with all things new wave and post punk. The Cribs encapsulated both sides of the  coin.<br><br>Chapter Two in the brothers Jarman family album burst in with the release of their recent Top 30 single. Hey Scenesters! - loosely based on their experience of people blagging their way to cool - and the new album THE NEW FELLAS.<br><br>Witnessed recently on fellow tykes Kaiser Chiefs UK tour, the album sees a new musically stream lined band laden with pop nous and 'have a good time' written all over them ... a perfect antidote to the mundane pop of recent years. THE NEW FELLAS, under laid with pop sensibility and the band's endearing rock n roll ethic, brings on a new dawn from the infectious strains and musical swagger of Martell, to the new single Mirror Kissers which, if live performances are anything to go by, has HIT written all over it.<br><br>Into Spring 2005, and with European shows supporting Bloc Party and Kaiser Chiefs in the bag, The Cribs announced a series of quickly sold out headline shows, as well being invited onto the NME / Rizla tour..</p>
