        <h1>The Pigeon Detectives - Animal</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Animal" recorded by The Pigeon Detectives. The review was written by Harry Bedford in 2013.</p>
    <p>There is some good songwriting here and the rest is compensated by its intense energy. Animal sees The Pigeon Detectives revert back to a sound that gave them multiple hits on their first album, Wait For Me. The record starts off well but after the first chorus the different sections seem to blend into one, as if they are trying desperately not to lose that all important energy. However the middle 8, with its processed vocals, is commendable and adds to the overall success of the song. The lyrics are witty, the sound is exciting, overall it's a great record that sees The Pigeon Detectives back to their best. Watch out for a new album and tour coming from the Rothwell lads soon...</p>
