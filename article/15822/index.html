        <h1>Soul Circus release Christmas single 'Picture Frames'</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2011.</p>
    <p>Leeds homeless charity, St George's Crypt, has teamed up with local indie band, Soul Circus, to release a Christmas single in a bid to raise much-needed funds and to raise awareness of the plight of the homeless over the festive period.<br /><br />The special edition single called 'Picture Frames' is to be released on Monday 5th December 2011, when it will be available for download via justgiving.com  with all proceeds going to St George's Crypt. It will also be available from iTunes, and users will be able to make a donation to the charity on the band's JustGiving page. Soul Circus will also be participating in other fundraising events for the Christian charity, including a performance for St George's Crypt clients on 20 December.<br /><br />Lloyd Bradley, lead singer for Soul Circus said: "Christmas can be a really special time for families, but also a very lonely time for those who find themselves homeless. St George's Crypt offers life-changing support that can make a huge difference to individuals who are often in vulnerable and unsafe situations. We are delighted to contribute to this worthy Leeds charity through our music, and hope that people will download the single and make a difference too."<br /><br />Cheryl Harrington of St George's Crypt said: "To have a charity single dedicated to our cause, is a huge honour. We can't thank Soul Circus enough for bringing something special to the charity; fundraising through music. At St Georges Crypt we serve approximately 700 hot meals every week and have been providing care and support for homeless, vulnerable and disadvantaged people since 1930. Annually, we need £1.4 million, so rely heavily on donations and the generosity from the public in order to run our services. Contributions like this are therefore invaluable."<br /><br />Soul Circus appeared at Isle of Wight festival in 2011 and Leeds and Reading festivals the previous year, and released their first single, 'The Myth' in October. 'Picture Frames' has been produced by Whiskas (Dance to the Radio, ¡Forward Russia!) at Mook Studios in Meanwood.</p>
