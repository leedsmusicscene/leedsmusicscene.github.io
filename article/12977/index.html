    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for Champagne For Enemies.</p>
    <p>Champagne For Enemies (formerly Secret In Today) started in early 2008 as a duo consisting of the founding members Mark Wright and Simon Walker. They jammed for a while, creating songs such as the now popular 'Drowning in Romance' and 'Feel the Same', before playing to empty pubs and clubs trying to get themselves heard.<br /><br />After some time they decided to appeal for a few more members to make the line up complete as a band. This is when Tony Hudson (drums) got in touch and decided he wanted to play, so after a few months of hard work and practice they started gigging as a 3 piece and growing their fan base whilst trying out a few different bass players.<br /><br />This continued until Tony's cousin Shane Hudson (now on bass) got in touch to arrange a jam. The guys bonded instantly and the full band was then complete.<br /><br />Regularly playing local venues and clubs like the Frontier (Batley Variety Club), Rios in Leeds, Cockpit Leeds, Manchester Academy to name a few..</p>
