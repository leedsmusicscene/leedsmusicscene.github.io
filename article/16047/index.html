        <h1>Wilful Missing - Molehills out of Mountains</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Molehills out of Mountains" recorded by Wilful Missing. The review was written by Benjamin Maney in 2012.</p>
    <p>For anyone having difficulty acclimatising themselves to the new year and brink of foretold apocalypse, the stark and refreshing optimism of Wilful Missing's debut album 'Molehills Out Of Mountains' may well  give new light and hope to an otherwise dreary and uninviting winter.<br /><br />The carefully crafted and intricately arranged album is astonishingly good. Avoiding the old pitfall of a folk album where every song sounds the same, the album burns with diverse ideas as the close and choral harmonies sing of any emotion you can care to suggest, conjuring heartache and spinning tales of a perfect reconciliation.  Welcoming you on an intimate journey through the furore of life's travesties and celebrations.<br /><br />This is the first full album release from the band, following two previous EP releases over the last few years, so set a date for the 23rd of January and agree that it has been worth the long and arduous wait. <br /><br />The predominant subject matter of the album is of course, as it usually is in these situations, the malleable fragility of the human ideals; 'love and loss'. An age old and well played subject matter that inevitably becomes expected and a little cliched. Not to say that the band don't execute their lyrical arrangements well and not without bouts of pretty poetical verses, the occasionally pained but always heartfelt vocals meander playfully over the pretty yet subtle guitars at perfectly timed intervals, throwing light on the softly brushed drums to create something quite individual that I am more than happy to lose myself in for the entire duration of the album.  <br />To pick a few highlights from the 11 song album proves difficult as the majority of songs, each in their own way have definite merits worth properly addressing. So to experience them all, buy the album and see for yourself as I shall only reveal a few here.<br /><br />Firstly, Sam Kipling's lyrics in the song 'like lovers do' are a testament to the songwriters ability. Anyone that says lyrics no longer depict truth or honesty, I challenge you to hear this and not be moved somewhat by his deeply honest and troubled words. Effortlessly alluring backing vocals lend the song variety and enchant both the ear and the mind at once.<br /><br />The song 'London Road' offers a more catchy and more upbeat approach. If I was in charge of choosing a single to release off the album, this would be my first choice. I've been having difficulty getting it out of my head since the first time I heard it. So approach with caution, as you will find yourself singing this absent-mindedly in possibly serious situations. <br /><br />An all round winner and an album I can tell I'll return to when I'm in need of some perspective.</p>
