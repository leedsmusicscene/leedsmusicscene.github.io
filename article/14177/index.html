    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for Phoenix Pearle.</p>
    <p>'Phoenix Pearle' is a new band created by writing and producing duo singer songwriter Sara Garvey aka Ella May of Nightmares on Wax, and producer / bassist Hamlet Luton aka James Naked. James Naked also of Nightmares. before leaving to join  Finley Quaye and Mozez  of Zero 7 both as a live musician and producer ,writing and producing albums for Neumann records. James has also toured with some of the biggest names in the reggae industry from John Holt to The Mighty Diamonds and played with artist such as Macy Gray and De La Soul.<br /><br />Garvey and Luton have made an album before, then known as Oak, that was highly anticipated, attracting the attention of 'Flood',  U2 and Nine Inch Nails producer, who went on to be their executive producer, and Youth, an accomplished writer/producer who has worked with artists as diverse as Killing Joke;  The Orb;  The Verve;  Paul McCartney;  Kate Bush;  U2; Embrace;  String Cheese Incident;  Dido;  Crowded House;  Primal Scream. The duo also co-wrote a song on their debut with Chris Martin of Coldplay. A major label bidding war happened to sign them before they had even finished their first album 'it was crazy we got all this attention on literally 3 tracks!' They went on to be signed by Interscope in the USA.<br /><br />'We both had written an album together before and were always drawn to writing together as we have similar outlooks on writing....we just do whatever we feel. There are no boundaries, no rules and this is extremely satisfying as an innovator, we use music in all its elements to document and articulate what we see, feel and hear around us' says Garvey, ' I believe in freedom of spirit and thought and a healthy rebellion for what's expected of you'.<br /><br />The duo pushed boundaries as Oak and see Phoenix Pearle as a next step. The sound of 'Phoenix Pearle' is a diverse and eclectic mix of influences. Singer Garvey has been said to be a cross between Erykah Badu, Bob Marley and Debbie Harry. Alongside Naked's fearless production,  PP definitely has its own sound with all the influences of reggae, soul, punk, and electro, with just enough commercial sensibilities to appeal to many but with an edge that will stretch the more discerning music lover. <br /><br />Already the band have attracted attention early on. With a couple of tracks major label Atlantic Records amongst others became immediately interested as did Producers Bacon & Quamby. <br /><br />'We heard a couple of tracks sent down from an A&R at Atlantic and were immediately excited we picked 'stay' to co-produce and where delighted that Phoenix Pearle have decided to release their debut Ep on our digital label' Jonathan Quamby<br /><br />BACON & QUAMBY ,the producers for Phoenix Pearle, are a Grammy and Brit award winning production team, who have produced for many acclaimed international acts such as: Finley Quaye, Bowie, Ziggy Marley, Sugarbabes, Beth Orton, Pretenders. <br /><br />Originally hailing from Sheffield South Yorkshire, the producers relocated to Rak Studio's in London, where they run their hugely successful digital Label AWAL, that has released such artists as Arctic Monkeys, Roisin Murphy and Faithless to name but a few.<br /><br />The bands live performance is astounding having played a few exclusive gigs over the summer as a warm up.<br />'Live performance is our thing', says Garvey, ' everyone in the band has toured the world numerous times with world class artists, we love it, this is what we do it for.' <br /><br />This is undeniable as separately they have toured with likes of Gnarls Barkley, Nightmares on Wax, Finley Quaye, Lemar .<br /><br />Phoenix Pearle's debut EP 'Better Hand' due out on AWAL early autumn with a release date yet to be decided.
