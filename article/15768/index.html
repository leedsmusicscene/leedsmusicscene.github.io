    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for Four Fighters.</p>
    <p>This band was formed in 2003 by Foo Fighters Fans for Foo Fighters fans! Four vastly experienced musicians came together for this project with a passion to recreate the sound of the now legendary Dave Grohl - fronted, American supergroup.<br /><br />Four Fighters can be found playing the most prestigious venues the length and breadth of the UK. Add to that regular multiple appearances at all of the biggest tribute festivals in the UK, Ireland and mainland Europe and you could argue that this is the world's ultimate Foo Fighters tribute band!<br /><br />Four Fighters' live shows are explosive events and the band go to every effort to reproduce the raw power and dynamics of the original band.<br /><br />All of the Foo Fighters studio albums, from their eponymous debut to the much acclaimed Echoes, Silence, Patience and Grace and the 2011 release Wasting Light are represented and given the live treatment by this band. They perform the songs with an energy and passion that only true fans could and perform them in the same way you would see and hear them at a Foo Fighters live show! Crowd favourites like This Is A Call, Stacked Actors, Learn To Fly, Everlong, The Pretender, All My Life, Best Of You, Rope, etc, etc are mainstays of the Four Fighters setlist.<br /><br />On occasion Four Fighters are even known to break out the acoustic guitars too and recreate the Foo Fighters' live acoustic shows....</p>
