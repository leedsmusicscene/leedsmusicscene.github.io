    <p>"Wow this girl can sing!'" - The Script<br />"Blown away!" - Labrinth<br />"She's the real deal" - Randy Jackson<br />With her home produced melancholy-pop and self-made videos, the multi-instrumentalist singer-songwriter-producer Kelly Mueller has already gained support from various powerhouse people around the world including Irish band The Script, Simon Cowell's Labrinth and fellow female producer Imogen Heap.<br />Travelling to LA, NY and Europe to meet and work with Rodney 'Darkchild' Jerkins (Michael Jackson), JR Rotem (Rihanna), The Invisible Men (Jessie J), The Script and Randy Jackson, the phone continued to ring. Kelly later performed aside Randy Crawford, signed to Universal music in Scandinavia, filmed a music video inNorway with 'Scandinavian idol' Bjorn Johan Muri and appeared for an exclusive performance on major Chinese television networks .<br />Kelly's music videos are renowned for their artistic edge and her live shows are both raw and unique, with homegrown loops and projections.<br />So what's next from this Yorkshire born ethereal girl? "Radio, shows, PR, Album and more radio! A lot of blood, sweat and fears!"<br />In 2011 Mueller reached number 1 in the Music Week charts with her self written and produced single 'She Cries'<br />In 2012 she released her debut EP 'There's No Light Without Shadow' as KELL ON URTH through US label Beverley Martel. The EP was written and produced entirely by Mueller and has been likened to Kate Bush, Lana Del Rey, Sade and Fiona Apple. Her most recent songs have been played on regional and national radio show BBC Introducing as well as appearing in various unsigned charts around the web.<br />"I'm not sure I've ever heard anyone with SO MUCH potential before..." Simon Li<br />"Kelly is one of the most talented writers, artists, and performers I have ever known. Kelly is a person with a rare gift, she is creative, meticulous, and driven to achieve her end result. She is a perfectionist." Mark Eddinger, Star West Ent.</p>
