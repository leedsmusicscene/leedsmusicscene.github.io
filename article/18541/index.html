    <p>Music has become so accessible. Every man and his dog is a producer these days. Gone are the days where people perfect there craft. Some of the biggest hits in the Pop Charts are just loops that have been drag-and-dropped in Apple's free basic music package "Garage Band".<br />Lyrics these days are just the same. Half-hearted, rushed, and cliché. Very few lyricists put their heart into their lyrics. As far as rap goes, you really have to sift through a huge catalogue of millennial rap songs before you find a rap artist that isn't talking about abusing drugs and alcohol, spending lots of money, or defiling women.<br />However I -Desmond- am a break from the norm. I put my heart and soul into my music. I think hard on the concepts and make sure I put [at least some of] my life into my lyrics; even the hypothetical song concepts. The mind behind the music is creative, experimental, diverse, poetic, (somewhat cryptic), and zealous.<br /><br />Don't believe me? Listen for yourself!.</p>
