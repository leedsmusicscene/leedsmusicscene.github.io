    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Pine / I Just Froze" recorded by Decoration. The review was written by Richard Garnett in 2006.</p>
    <p>Despite the glorious critical response to last year's long playing debut “Don’t Disappoint Me Now”, Decoration undeservingly remain very much a band worshipped by only a select few. Even though that select few includes the long list of pretenders to the Peel crown in whose court they first found favour. “Pine” was an absolute delight as a demo before signing to SL Records and now it is as much of a pleasure again as a proper single. An everyday tale of love blossoming in a garden centre, it says “pah” and “pish” to the Artic Monkeys hype-mobile proving clever lyrics were around long before those lads came along. “I Just Froze” is a straight up Christmas song, but sadly it won’t be destined for any festive compilations, as they may actually worth listening to if they contained this breed of sparkling Indie-guitars. Extra b-side “See You in the New Year” takes a darker look at the festive season building a cutting number around a droning Hammond and tortured guitar. Don’t disappoint yourself by missing out on Decoration.</p>
