    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for Santabarbara.</p>
    <p>Formed in April 2006, Santabarbara are a four piece rock band whose electrical presence and dominating sound are turning the heads of music fans, young and old alike.<br><br>Tom "Fliss Fisk" Syms (drums) searched for other members to create a new rock 'n' roll band. Through profuse searching he eventually managed to find Seb Santabarbara (lead guitar).<br><br>The duo started jammin' over old rock and metal songs and came to the decision to find a bassist and singer. Craig Smith (bass) was the next to join the band and finally, after a long search they found the perfect vocalist for the job: Jo Robertshaw. It took a long time for the band to think of a name, and there were a lot of disagreements, but in the end it was Tom's Uncle who gave them the idea of using Santabarbara as the band name, and the rest is history.<br><br>Influenced by bands such as Van Halen, Motley Crue, Metallica and AC/DC, Santabarbara present a sound uncommon in the present music scene. Their fast, hard-hitting riffs and raw, memorable lyrics are are leaving audiences stunned.<br><br>The band started gigging in July playing their first gig at the Rendezvous Hotel, Skipton and since then have become part of the Leeds music scene playing places such as Atrium, Primrose and also Bradford Rio's (who have hosted the likes of Saxon, Skid Row, Helloween, Diamond Head and many more).<br><br>With a strong set-list that constantly grows in length and popularity, this band are fast becoming the next in a long line rock N roll figures. From the first introductory snare-crack to the last wail of Seb's too-hot-to-handle guitar solos, Santabarbara are, undoubtedly, a force to be reckoned with!!.</p>
