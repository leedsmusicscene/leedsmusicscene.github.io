    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2013.</p>
    <p>Following on the recent announcement of Katriona Gilmour taking over as Editor, Leeds Music Scene is pleased to announced that Sam Monk is also joining the editorial team. He takes over the reins of the Live Reviews section of the site. <br /><br />Sam said, "Having grown up both in the outer suburbs of Sydney and in a small home counties market town neither of which were a musical hotbed, I count myself very lucky that I now live in a city with such a vibrant live music scene. From Leeds Festival and Live at Leeds to the Brudenell and the Cockpit right down to The Library and The Packhorse there is an endless stream of great live music in Leeds and I am excited to help illuminate all of this activity as Editor of the live reviews section. Simply put I am a music fan who wants to get more involved.<br /><br />I am keen to put together a roster of reviewers to produce print, video and audio. If this sounds like something you might be interested in please get in touch. Did I also mention that there will be offers of free tickets and press passes. <br /><br />That's all for now. Happy gig-going." <br /><br />Sam can be contacted at livereviews [ at ] leedsmusicscene.net or followed on Twitter @smonk78.<br /><br />Welcome to the team Sam!</p>
