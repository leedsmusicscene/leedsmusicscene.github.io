    <p>Bands weve played with<br /><br />The Ghost of a Thousand<br />The Casino Brawl<br />The Deaf Havanah<br />Blackhole<br />Seven Year Kismit<br />Yashin<br />Young Guns<br />The Humour<br />In Me<br />Sacred Mother Tongue<br />The Dead Formats<br />Shadows Chasing Ghosts<br />Between the Ocean and Us<br />The Vehicle Field<br />Sterling<br />Empires Fade<br /><br />A last Concern are a Leeds based Screamo/Metalband made up by Greg Dickson (vox) Rob Massey (guitars) Clark Franics (Guitars) Tom Batten (Bass) and Paul key (drums)<br /><br />A band with an intricate metal sound, light and shade in contrast with a twist of melodic brutality for good measure, A Last Concern have already secured two appearances and support on BBC Radio Leeds Raw Talent Extra (online approx 30,000 listeners world wide) and have had exclusive BBC Introducing (Alan Raw) plays of tracks from their self produced freshman EP "Whats the point living if you don't feel alive."¬ù (reviewed 4/5 by www.leedsmusicscene.net)<br /><br />The last few months have seen an increasingly impressive roster of support slots currently with the Metal Hammer Incomming tour supporting 'The Deaf Havanah',' The Casino Brawl' and 'Young Gun's, and previously with bands The Ghost of a Thousand, The dead Formats (visible noize), Sacred Mother Tongue (Download 2009) and InMe.<br /><br />A Last Concern's powerful blend of heart felt musical offerings are getting talked about fast. With their first music video directed by Adam Fair (the cribs) more dates with established touring bands in conversation, 1 E.P down and their sophamore EP release imminent the timing is definately right for a full on Beat Down offensive..</p>
