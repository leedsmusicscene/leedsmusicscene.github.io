    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for Fountainhead.</p>
    <p>The unique sounds of Fountainhead have been reverberating around Yorkshire for the past year and striking a chord with many. The rich vocal style and heartfelt songs from lead singer Bethany Dowsett come infused with music from around the world, as guitars and percussion blend fragments of flamenco, folk, country and highlife into beautiful and catchy songs.<bR><br>Formed in 2002 by Tom and Beth the band has been joined by many collaborators and friends since they started. They played their first gig as a 5-piece in February 2003. Nowadays they prefer the simplicity of playing as a duo, but are still often joined at gigs by a second guitar or percussion.<bR><Br>Currently based around Leeds they have played gigs in Belgium, Spain and all over Yorkshire. They have been described as "the very creative and totally unique" Helen Rhodes (Snooty Fox Wakefield) and as "A class act" by John Waller (Topic Folk club in Bradford)..</p>
