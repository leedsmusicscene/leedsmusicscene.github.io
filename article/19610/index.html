    </div>
    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2016.</p>
    <p>Having announced Local Natives, Roots Manuva, Hookworms and Anna Meredith earlier last month, Beacons Metro have this week added more acts to their 2016 events.<br /> <br />Leading the announcement is American alt-rock and grunge pioneers Dinosaur Jr, who will be performing at the Beacons Metro opening party at Leeds University Stylus on October 26th [tickets].<br /><br />Canadian post-hardcore heroes Fucked Up will be performing their highly acclaimed debut 'Hidden World' in full at the Belgrave on October 27th [tickets], joined by one of the brightest lights of Nashville's thriving DIY rock movement, the quad guitar'd chaos of Diarrhea Planet.<br /> <br />The 27th October will also see Boxed In, the project of songwriter & producer Oli Bayston descend on Headrow House [tickets], hot on the heels of their most recent single, the punchy and electronic 'Jist'. <br /><br />The reigning Queen of UK hip-hop Lady Leshurr will be returning to Leeds to lay waste to the Belgrave Music Hall, elsewhere Cats Eyes, consisting of the Horror's Faris Badwan, Italian-Canadian soprano, composer and multi-instrumentalist Rachel Zeffira and a huge supporting cast of musicians will perform at the beautiful Howard Assembly Rooms. Krrum are scheduled to return to Headrow House, and finally, New York based singer-songwriter Margaret Glaspy who is quickly establishing herself as an exciting and forward thinking songwriter, will be making her Leeds debut at Headrow House on the 6th November.<br /><br />As well as individual show tickets, there are a limited number of Beacons Metro 2016 Season Passes available that will give you access to all the Beacons Metro shows at a significant discount.
