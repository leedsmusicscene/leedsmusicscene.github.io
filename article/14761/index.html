    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for I Drew First Blood.</p>
    <p>We're I Drew First Blood, a five piece Hardcore/Metal band from Huddersfield, West Yorkshire with influences from The Ghost Inside, The Acacia Strain, Hundredth, For The Fallen Dreams, Thick As Blood.<br /><br /><br />After forming in 2009 IDFB have always had a problem securing a 2nd guitarist but in 2010 they found someone who was just as committed. After re-writing sets and playing Locally around the Yorkshire area IDFB broke out of Yorkshire and started playing anywhere they can gaining a reputation for their energetic live shows with their mixture of melodic hardore and heavy beatdowns. So far 2011 has been a great year for IDFB and they plan to make it even better with an EP release in June/July and a tour to follow the release in August/September. Also in September IDFB are set to Support Desolated once again and in November are set to support Texas In July (USA - Equal Visions Records)..</p>
