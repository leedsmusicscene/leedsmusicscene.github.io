    <p>Oxjam is Oxfam's month-long festival of grassroots music, which raises money to fight poverty and suffering around the world.  <br /><br />Throughout October, volunteers organise hundreds of music events, of all types and genres, across the UK.  The centrepiece of the festival is the Oxjam Takeover - vibrant multi-venue gigs happening in towns and cities nationwide, all on one weekend in October.  <br /><br />Oxjam are on the hunt for some exceptional individuals to become their most dedicated volunteers - Oxjam Takeover Managers - who will lead teams of supporters to produce a series of fundraising events, culminating in an Oxjam Takeover in Leeds in October.<br /><br />Oxjam are looking for people who are passionate about their local music scene. Applicants will need to have real leadership skills with plenty of enthusiasm.  Being an Oxjam Takeover manager is challenging and time-consuming but also highly rewarding and lots of fun.  Oxjam will provide training and ongoing support from their regional teams.<br /><br />Find out more and download an application form from bit.ly/oxjamtakeover. When applying write "Takeover Manager Leeds" in the subject line.<br /><br />Application deadline is Sunday 17th March.</p>
