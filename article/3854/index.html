        <h1>DanMoFo - Room 101</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Room 101" recorded by DanMoFo. The review was written by Danny Martin in 2005.</p>
    <p>Dan MoFo quotes “Our style has been described as very laidback and completely fresh and original”. To whoever said this I must disagree. From early “Radiohead” to “Gomez” through to the uber-bizzare delights of “Mudskipper” this album oozes influence and impression. Fresh and Orginal are throwaway remarks which piss me off because they seem to come from a viewpoint that carrying a mentor's influence is a bad thing? It isn't. In my opinion MoFo are far from orginal; however, they are rather excellent.<br><br>Haunting lyrics and dark somber, melodies pregnate this album. Vocals straining to be beautiful amidst a mess of bittersweet kamikazee symphonies. The work put into these tunes is astonishing. Acoustic heartbeats, delightful guitar picks and a never-ending array of devine effects that would make Moby dribble. Standouts include the glorious “Everman” which seems to float through the air effortlessly and the truly jawdropping “My little Lung”. 1 minute 13 seconds of blissful candid lyrics and superb guitar work - “Well it's not over now, cant you see I'm not done. If I stop breathing would you blow up my little lung”.<br><br>Homemade and homegrown. Yet produced to a standard out of reach for many already established bands. Seriously folks, MoFo are deadly serious about this and have wittled out a little beauty here.</p>
