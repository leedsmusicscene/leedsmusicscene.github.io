    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2011.</p>
    <p>With (accurate) rumours frequenting cyberspace the last few days, organisers of the annual Live At Leeds festival have today confirmed that The Pigeon Detectives have been added to the bill for Live At Leeds 2011, taking the "special guests" slot at the Cockpit.<br /><br />Simon Stevens, main booker of the festival, explains "We were discussing this year's runners, riders and last minute additions with The Pigeon Detectives at their recent sold out show at Leeds Metropolitan University when we realised that despite playing Live At Leeds in 2007 and 2008 they had never played as part of the wristbanded event. We all decided it would be amazing if they could play this year, we made a few calls and the rest as they say is history".<br /><br />The Pigeon Detectives will be performing at The Cockpit tommorow at 6.30pm. <br /><br />Be there early!</p>
