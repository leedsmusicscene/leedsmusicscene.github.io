    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Unfinished Drawings" recorded by Unfinished Drawings. The review was written by Joseph C Seager in 2009.</p>
    <p>Since their debut album back in 2007, Unfinished Drawings have had great exposure playing support slots with Feeder, Boy Kill Boy and The Holloways. Adding a few electronic beats and samples to their skillset, the Leeds-based band bring out a new EP that shows how they've matured.<br /><br />All their tracks have elements of beauty and simplicity. The acoustic guitars combined with mellow vocal work and the addition of the electronic bits and bobs not only make everything altogether more interesting, but gives them an edge on acoustic act rivals on the scene. It's music to relax to, to have an aged whiskey with rather than a bottle of Thunderbird. Beep! Magazine say not to judge a book by its cover and as I try not to, I wouldn't have thought that music this exquisite would come from a couple of chaps, one who looks like a 'road protester' and the other who is 'a cheeky faced inebriate.' <br /><br /> 'Verdana' opens sounding like a 90's video game whilst the vocals throughout the EP are far superior to a vast array of artists currently out there doing this in front of millions of people. I was worried that the band may not correlate with my expectations, but they totally do, and step way past my expectation line. I was drawn (ha!) to the band due to their name, it conjured up splendour, magic, and indeed music that could be played over animations of hand drawings. That is what I expected. That's what I got, and I'm all the happier for it!</p>
