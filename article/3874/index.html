    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Everyday I Love You Less and Less" recorded by Kaiser Chiefs. The review was written by Richard Garnett in 2005.</p>
    <p>If the tactics seem familiar don’t be too surprised: exposure, exposure, exposure, gig, gig, gig and then do it all again 10 times over, meanwhile progressively release every song off the album as a single although half of them actually aren’t that good and eventually even your mum will be humming the tune to Everyday I Love You Less & Less and saying “these Clever Chiefs are very good aren’t they”. If it sounds familiar it’s because under the wing of Franz Ferdinand’s management the formula that worked so well for them is currently being employed on our very own Chiefs. One possible side effect - You will be sick to death of them by the end of it... but who cares they’ll be millionaires!<bR><bR>So to the single you already own, because you already own the album... no wait it’s a remix! Is it?!?! You’re a genius if you can spot the difference. How apt therefore that a band with such an enormous amount of over exposure heading their way should release a song called “Everyday I Love You Less & Less”. Just a shame there was no irony intended. Fortunately we are not yet on the releases of the really average songs from the album and there’s enough spike to keep up with the pop-momentum of previous chart worriers “Oh My God” and “I Predict a Riot”.</p>
