    <p>Two more outstanding acts have today been confirmed for Bradford Council's three-day Bingley Music Live. They join Athlete, Russo and Dot Rotten who were added earlier this week.<br /><br />Ragga-metal outfit Skindred, who are a firm favourite on the live circuit, and alternative rockers Young Guns have joined the bill of one the north's best loved festivals.<br /><br />Fresh from playing to a packed crowd at the Download festival last weekend, Skindred promise to deliver a high octane set that will draw on their new album 'Union Black'. The Newport quartet have been combining elements of punk, rock, metal, reggae and electronic music since they formed in 1998 and have been compared to both The Prodigy and Living Colour.<br /><br />Young Guns have been touted as the next big British rock band and have gained plenty of column inches since releasing their debut album, 'All Our Kings Are Dead', last July. The High Wycombe hardcore quintet have since played high-profile support slots with Bon Jovi and Lostprophets, with whom they have been compared.<br /><br />Weekend tickets are just Â£35 plus a booking fee, and are available from See Tickets.</p>
