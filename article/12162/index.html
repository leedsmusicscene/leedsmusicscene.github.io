    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for Plumhall.</p>
    <p>Michelle Plum began her musical career in the highly successful duo 'The Accidental Tourists' with Charlie Daykin who toured the UK and Europe. Michelle was also in the original line-up of 'Waking The Witch' before leaving to tour with the huge chart-band 'Chumbawamba'. Michelle played practically every major European festival (including Glastonbury) with the band, singing lead vocals and playing keyboards. Michelle has since been concentrating on song-writing and playing as a solo artist. Michelle is justly acclaimed for her beautiful and unique vocals.<br /><br />Nick is best known as one-half of the well-loved acoustic folk duo 'The Hall Brothers'. With this band he has toured the UK and played in Ireland and Holland and released several acclaimed albums through indie label Confidential Records. In between Hall Brothers commitments Nick works as a solo artist, having released the album 'The Golden Time' and the E.P 'Undertow' which was produced by Dave Reilly ('China Crisis') and Chris O'Neill ('George Harrison' in the hit film 'Backbeat'). 'Undertow' sold particularly well and received reviews that concentrated on his 'emotive voice' and unique song-writing style..</p>
