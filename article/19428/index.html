    <p>'Having spent the last year honing their sound, alt-pop band Heir are set to release their highly anticipated debut EP, 'When The Lights Went Out' on March 12th.  The EP will be available exclusively in physical form when released at the launch night at 360 Club.  After this date it will be available to order on Bandcamp and in our favourite record stores, Jumbo and Crash. <br /><br />Stamping their unique take on modern pop music with the pairing of powerful harmonies and hooks with grit and organic song-craft, the Leeds based band have enjoyed an exhilarating twelve months.  <br /><br />After blowing the crowd away at their sell-out gig in Leeds at the end of March, the band have since supported the likes of Honne and The Dunwells, toured the country with Karima Francis and enjoyed back-to-back BBC support for their previous two singles. Their latest release 'Scrapped Paper', described as a 'heartfelt masterstroke of energetic pop music' (Anthem review) is accompanied by a music video certain to leave you with a smile on your face, if not a little out of breath! <br /><br />Continuing to deliver material with such quality, it is easy to see why these guys are surrounded by a whirlwind of excitement.  "We are absolutely thrilled with the response so far" says frontman Tom Hammond. 'It means so much when people go out of their way to show such support. For us, we are just itching to keep producing work that people can enjoy" <br /><br />As individuals with varying musical backgrounds, their arrangements combine a colourful set of sounds that demonstrate their infectious enthusiasm for what they do. Having gigged regularly up and down the country and been broadcast on national radio, they have left listeners eagerly anticipating their next move. <br /><br />The EP launch will take place at The 360 Club in Leeds on March 12th. Heir are a band staking their claim as one of the most exciting young acts in the country, so make sure that when the stage is set and the lights finally do go out, you are there to soak up every second. <br /><br />Watch the video for 'Scrapped Paper' here:<br /><br /><iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mOJTBr0cIUQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
