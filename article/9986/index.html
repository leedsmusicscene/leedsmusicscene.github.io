    <p>Starting out in 2007, the experimental/electronic duo from the east of Leeds in the UK debuted with their 2008 EP 'A Briefcase Full of Suspicion' (LYFCD001).  This lead to an invite from husband and wife duo Justin and Helen Watson (founders of the Front & Follow label) to contribute to their 14 Versions Of The Same EP / Long Division With Remainders project along with such artists as Sone Institute, Spool Ensemble and Leyland Kirby.  The Truth About Frank's 'Version 11' emerged in February 2009 (LDWR11).<br /><br />In September of the same year came the release of a third EP 'Neon Fractured Night' (W&W027) on the German netlabel Weird&Wired, and in April 2010, The Truth About Frank released their 4 track 'Murder Sleep' EP (LYFCD002).<br /><br />2010 also saw contributions to several compilation and remix projects (including participation on the Headphonica label's Ergo Phizmiz remix project 'The Faust Re.Cycled' and the pulling together of all 14 contributions to the Long Division With Remainders project for release as a 4CD box set on the Front & Follow label.  Their track 'The Headless Rentman' was also selected for the album 'Broadcast One' (Oddbox Records) a compilation curated by the internet-based Dandelion Radio, (the same track also making it to number 9 in the station's Festive Fifty' - the former John Peel mainstay now officially hosted by Dandelion). <br /><br />2011's 'Cannibal Work Ethic' is the duo's first full length release and is the culmination of work undertaken over a period of months in 2010 and 2011.  All selections have been composed and recorded by The Truth About Frank, with the opener 'Love Is A Cage' featuring a vocal contribution from Mongolian multi-media artist Tsendpurev Tsegmid.<br /><br />A Briefcase Full Of Suspicion - "...Abstractly awkward and awesome stuff..." www.losingtoday.com<br /><br />LDWR Version 11 - "...never overpowering (despite the obvious power)...magnetic, hypnotic..."  "http://www.organart.com" www.organart.com<br /><br />Neon Fractured Night - "...fractured and emblackened semi-industrial grindery...very impressive stuff executed with economy and precision" The Sound Projector<br /><br />Murder Sleep - "...the best release I heard so far by them...definitely a road to explore" Vital Weekly.</p>
