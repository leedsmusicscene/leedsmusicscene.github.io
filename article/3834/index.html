    <p class="lead">This is a review of "The Announcement / Lips" recorded by The Printed Sound. The review was written by Rory Holl in 2005.</p>
    <p>First thing that comes into mind is The Killers crossing paths with The Kings Of Leon, so nothing overly original here. But having said that it's not that bad. The players themselves are very tight and know how to play their instruments well. But I just can't get over their regurgitation of the huge showering of Nu-Wave indie grabbed by bands such as The Killers, Franz Ferdinand and The Libertines.<Br><br>"The Announcement" is just too short and uninteresting to ever make it huge, it's not bad, it's a pleasant tune to listen to but it really is nothing that is going to break the Indie Mould that has set in the past year or two.<br><br>Track two "Lips" has the same whining indie feel and I just feel this is a carry-on of the last track as I can't really identify a huge difference between them. If you are a person who really enjoys any jumpy indie music then I guess this one is for you but in my own opinion it really doesn't do it for me!</p>
