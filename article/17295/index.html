    <p>'Time Will Tell' is the new release from Claire Cameron Band, marking the growth of the group into writing collectively and creating music as a fully fledged unit. With a raw storytelling narrative the album straddles the Gothic and singer songwriter genres, with nods to the metal musical sphere punctuating the music with powerful moments of light and dark. The band recorded with Neil Sadler, whose credits include working at Maison Rouge (Jethro Tull) with Laura Marling on her early recordings, and the acclaimed Blues Rock Guitarist Larry Miller, at No Machine Studios.<br /><br />The new release had its first airing on BBC Radio Leeds with Alan Raw on BBC West Yorkshire Introducing, and on the same evening Michelle Dalgety from Yorkshire Music Collective interviewed the band and played the CD on her radio show on BCB radio.  Claire was interviewed by The Music Fix to mark the release and The Star ran a competition to win signed copies of the CD.  After a successful London launch party at 100 Club,Claire Cameron Band supported Carina Round at The Well, with fellow Leeds band Sawsound, finishing off a storming year with a headline set at The Pit n Pendulum, Nottingham before going back into rehearsals ready for a 2013 New Year Tour!<br /><br />Kicking off supporting Tom Hingley in Bradford and featuring a London show at Cargo and a Leeds launch party at 360 Club the Time Will Tell Tour is set to be an electric set of shows!!<br /><br />Visit http://www.reverbnation.com/clairecameronband for the dates!</p>
