    <p>Gizeh Records have this week revealed that they will be releasing Glissando's new record 'With Our Arms Wide Open We March Towards the Burning Sea' on June 23rd. The album is available to pre-order now through the label’s online store.<br><br>In addition to the main release, there will be a limited edition cassette version available of just 20 copies.<br><br>'With Our Arms Wide Open We March Towards the Burning Sea' has a dark, gentle heartbeat that opens up an atmosphere lost and bleak but through Elly May Irving's vocal there is always a sense of wonder, a thought that something otherworldly is occurring.<br><br>There is an ambience to the record that throws it into the vein of some of the Kranky labels releases but it's more orchestral than that, there's more melody and a lyrical content that just seems to suck you in and hold you close.<br><br>Glissando's previous comparisons have been to such visionaries as Low and iLiKETRAiNS' Dave Martin provides a guest vocal on the album.<br><br>Glissando embark on their biggest UK tour to date in May, playing at Leeds’ Packhorse venue on May 13th.</p>
