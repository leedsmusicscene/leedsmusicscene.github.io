    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2011.</p>
    <p>Since the release of Sketches' critically acclaimed single 'Bleed Victoria' (Label Fandango), the Leeds based quartet have gone from strength to strength. <br /><br />The band have been on the road supporting the likes of Minus The Bear, The Thermals, Alberta Cross, Everything Everything, I Like Trains and I Am Arrows, amongst many others.<br /><br />Summer 2010 offered Sketches great slots at The Great Escape Festival, Y-Not Festival and Dot To Dot Festival, as well as being hand-picked by the BBC to perform at both the Reading & Leeds Festival where one of their songs was chosen to be televised on BBC3.<br /><br />Autumn saw the band release a strictly limited edition EP which quickly won admiration from fans and industry alike - made evident by radio support from the likes of Tom Robinson, Steve Lamacq and several regional BBC stations.<br /><br />Sketches have since been in the studio with Richard Formby, whose credits include the Mercury Prize nominated 'Two Dancers' (Wild Beasts) to record their upcoming single 'My Father's Son' due for release on 28th February 2011.<br /><br />You can watch the video for 'My Father's Son' below.<br /><br /><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/18518062" width="400" height="225" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
