        <h1>Mainline - Turn On</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Turn On" recorded by Mainline. The review was written by Danny Martin in 2005.</p>
    <p>A fair enough offering here from Leeds based Mainline.  Strutting somewhere between The Stones and The Hives, Mainline merge a strong bassline with jetstreams of guitar highlighted by the gravelled tones of lead vocal Rob Wheelhouse.<br><br>If The Stones are a benchmark then “Turn on” is what you would expect, really. Eccentric and vibrant in places, jagged guitar riffs and a constant soothing undertone. If musical competence were the Holy Grail then Mainline would have nearly hit gold. Sadly it isn’t though and this is where this offering falls short in a way, it just doesn’t have much spark. Nothing to stand it out from the crowd, and Jesus the crowd round these parts is so brimming with talent that what could be considered not half bad, just gets chewed up and spat out.<br><br>“Selfish” is of the same creed, but holds a torch of hope that may just keep this baby alive. It brims with expectation and youthfulness, a brief ‘Chiefs-esque sing-along, crazed guitars and some nice tidy work by the Skin Basher Neil Holdsworth wraps this tune up into something I could become affectionate for.<br><br>No it isn’t going to set the world alight. But if this is a start for Mainline, then as building blocks go it's pretty damn solid.</p>
