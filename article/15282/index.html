    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for Callum Macintyre.</p>
    <p>Callum joined Pontefract NEW College and took the subjects Law, Maths and ICT. After a year, he decided to restart college and pursue a career in Music. He then joined a new band called "Day Of Absence" which again was a 2 part band with guitarist Adam Murray which allowed him to try his hand at being a lead singer, contrasting acoustic and electric backgrounds into one band. Unfortunately musical differences broke the band up.<br /><br />From then Callum Macintyre began his solo career busking in Leeds which also lead to several opportunities for paid gigs and being noticed. This quickly lead to youtube videos and breaking into the regular gigging scene.<br /><br />He has also joined a Heavy Rock band called "Below Zero" becoming the lead singer and showing his ability and range with several different genres. Members including previous guitarist Adam Murray, bassist Joe Vause and drummer Tom Moore.<br /><br />For now Callum Macintyre is seen regularly busking on the streets of Leeds and Pontefract whilst pursuing his path into the competitive music industry, studying BTEC Music, Photography and Media at A-Level at Pontefract NEW College.<br /><br />Currently travelling with his music, busking around Great Britain with lead singer of the band Alice At Last (of which he manages) He has accompanied Lucas Smith during several gigs around the coast..</p>
