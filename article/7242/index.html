    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for Earl Cadenza.</p>
    <p>Earl Cadenza are a young duo who blast out improvisational, instrumental music heavily influenced by Post-Rock, Experimental Indie and Post-Hardcore bands such as Biffy Clyro, Death From Above 1979, Explosions in the Sky, Fall of Troy, Faraquet, Fugazi, The Mars Volta, Mogwai, Muse, Oceansize and Radiohead.<br><br>Harry Rhodes looks after guitars, occasionally bass and vocals (and an overwhelming amount of tap-dance-worthy FXpedals), whilst Jamie Milton (also Singer/Guitarist of Annie is a Comic Strip) holds it all together on the percussional side of things (that is, drums and anything else that goes bang, Harry's amp aside).<br><br>Their live shows can only be descibed as a series of instrumental, winding 'Movements' ranging from chilled ambience, to frenetic funk building to dirty heavy riffs often climaxing in a crescendo of beeps, glitches and a massive wall of sound. The duo are yet to venture into the studio, but already have a full 30 minute show professionally recorded on DVD courtesy of Pawprint Records, Wakefield (this includes professional lighting, and sound controlled by the engineers at Wakefield's Snooty Fox live music venue).<br><br>After playing their first few gigs, the guys are enthusiastic to further their experiance and scope, and play with as many different acts at as many different venues as possible around the region. If you can give these boys a slot to fill, get in touch!.</p>
