    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Untitled" recorded by Three Random Words. The review was written by Gavin Miller in 2004.</p>
    <p>Remember those bands you had when you were in school? The one I was in, unfortunately, split up after a while, but I’m convinced we’d sound like this if we had kept it together. That’s not an insult on Three Random Words, who have some damn catchy songs, as evidenced here. ‘Losing By Default’ is my favourite with its crystal clear guitar, its steady drumming and the fresh lyrics, it’s the pick of the bunch.<br><br>‘Bullets of Love’ is the first track, and starts like a Strokes-lite tune; the booming monotonous bass, the one note guitar lead and the robotic drumming. Then, all of a sudden, it changes. Oh well, can’t win ‘em all. It seems on this CD that as they’ve recorded it properly in a studio, that they’ve thrown everything at every song. The guitars sound über processed sometimes, and even the drums sound like they’re made out of cardboard. Ironically enough, they’ve left the vocals completely alone. Well, it doesn’t matter too much, he’s got quite a nice voice anyway.<br><br>‘Revelation’ is track three (number two being ‘Losing By Default’) and is the slow, sensitive one. After a shaky start, the track picks up some pace. Although please, get rid of that fucking annoying guitar lead thing during the verses. Yeah, this is nice. Not great, but nice. Very melodic, I’ll say that much.<br><br>‘Outta Control’ sees the band enter the territory of the NME- band. Fuzzed up guitar and snarling vocals make for one of the weakest tracks here. Try not to think of Razorlight at the beginning. And try not to laugh when lead singer Roger Rowley sings “motherfucker”.<br><br>‘Not In Ludlow’ is another clean guitar, jangly, mid 90s indie song, complete with the trademark descending riffs, catchy chorus, and fairly funny lyrics. It’s a quaint song, and it’s pretty cool to boot.<br><br>‘Waving Goodbye’ is fittingly, the last song, and is more of the same strummy guitars and catchy chorus with some soaring vocal moments. It’s not the best track here, but it’s a nice enough ending.<br><br>Full of that youthful energy and promise, this is just the start of the Three Random Words saga. Expect the groupies, TV’s out of the window and smack habits to crop up later. Or, maybe not, as this is the kind of band that sit in the same category of a Snow Patrol, or a Coldplay, etc. So replace the sex, drugs and rock ‘n roll with just being nice. Hey, look where it got Chris Martin, he gets to go home to Gwyneth Paltrow every night. Anyway, this CD shows a lot of promise, and I’m sure Three Random Words can go on to do bigger and better things.</p>
