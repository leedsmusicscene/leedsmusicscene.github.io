        <h1>Black Wolf Catch - Crackpot Summer Lodge</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Crackpot Summer Lodge" recorded by Black Wolf Catch. The review was written by Stacey Fawcett in 2012.</p>
    <p>Black Wolf Catch describes themselves as 'a trio that create heartfelt indie music with a unique and quirky twist.' This happy little record is certainly heartfelt indie music, but I am still yet to hear the unique and quirky twist. It has all the makings of a good indie record, emotional lyrics, staccato drums and guitar breaks with a few twinkly bits. But that is about it really. It isn't bad at all, just nothing truly memorable. In a live situation this band may work better and could be successful but as far as this record goes I'm not quite getting it. The direction of the band is what I don't get as there are some pop punk elements which could be nice if explored, possibly making more use of the female vocal presence.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Indie music, then you will like this.</p>
