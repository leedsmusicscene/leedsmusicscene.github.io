    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2009.</p>
    <p>The Dharma will release their first official single in February at their launch party at the Cockpit on Friday 6th February. The single, ‘Passwords’, was produced at Soundwork studios in Leeds by award winning producer Will Jackson (The Pigeon Detectives, The Cribs, Kaiser Chiefs).<br><br>In other news, The Dharma have issued a request to all local schools and youth organisations, in the hope of finding a support act to take the stage with them at a headline gig this year.<br><br>“I feel that over the years, a lot of schools and facilities for young people seem to have left music behind somewhat. We want to try and awaken kids’ interests again and get them asking more about getting involved with music groups or workshops in their areas. There is a lot of talent out there which constantly needs to brought to the forefront and hopefully we can start a young group off down that path by offering them a support slot and the chance to play in front of hundreds of people.” said lead singer, Paul Houlihan.<br><br>Bands are invited to submit their music - visit the band’s official website for more information.</p>
