        <h1>Leeds bands to feature on a new Dance To The Radio compilation album</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2007.</p>
    <p>Originally due to be part two of Dance To The Radio’s last compilation, 'Out of The Woods And Trees' comes out a little later than intended and is the label’s most ambitious compilation yet.<br><Br>In only its third year the Leeds-based label has gone from strength to strength, with six Top 40 singles under its belt and a Gold-selling, Top 3 album from The Pigeon Detectives. The label is renowned for introducing new talent, with Sky Larkin set to release their second single in October, Grammatics set to launch their assault with their debut single, 'Shadow Committee', and Doncaster’s The Wallbirds releasing their début single.<br><Br>This new compilation is the brainchild of all those involved in DTTR and a result of 12 months of searching for new talent in and around Leeds. A mix of older and newer bands in their own field brought together in their own mix, this compilation is more accomplished than its processors in every way. From acoustic bliss to ravaged electronica to post-rock bliss in 20 easy steps.<br><Br>The full line-up for the compilation includes:<br><Br>Bobby Cook / The Chapman Family / The Displacements / ¡Forward, Russia! / Fran Rodgers / Grammatics / Held By Hands / Howling Bells / I Concur / Kotki Dwa / Mother Vulpine / The Pigeon Detectives / Prego / Shut Your Eyes & You’ll Burst Into Flames / Sky Larkin / Snowden / The Taste / Vessels / The Wallbirds / You Slut!</p>
