    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for Yalla Yallas, The.</p>
    <p>ROB GALLOWAY - VOCALS, RHYTHM GUITAR<br />WILL GRINDER - RHYTHM/LEAD GUITAR<br />MATTHEW DEMPSEY - BASS<br />MATT DELAHUNTY - DRUMS<br /><br />The Yalla Yallas are a punk rock 'n' roll band from Leeds, their name was carefully and deliberately chosen as a rallying call to unify. "So long liberty, lets forget you didn't show. Not in my time" a sentiment expressed on an early Joe Strummer recording, one which spurned him on to form The Mescaleros, and one which struck a chord with the band and their audience.<br /><br />Some members have appeared in other Leeds based punk rock bands The Dead Pets, 3milehigh and The Gushers. Others have built up a solid reputation as solo performers. All of them now share a common goal to bring anthemic mayhem to whichever venue they play.<br /><br />Several rehearsal and recording sessions yielded mixed results, after nearly 12 months in and out of various studios, having lost entire eps worth of material and one drummer, they finally succeeded in recording mixing, and mastering debut single "Retaliation (Doesn't Make It Alright) / Stand Up" which would not have been possible without the tenacious efforts of producer/engineer Grant Henderson<br /><br />Although their sound may hark back to a time when rock 'n' roll and punk rock invoked some sort of reaction, their progressive forward-looking vision makes any previous live music credentials or influences irrelevant. You don't need to know that Will once played in a flooded underground nuclear fall out shelter in the Czech Republic, you don't need to know that Rob hosted his own radio show playing everything from traditional folk to poodle metal. All you need to know is The Yalla Yallas are here, right now..</p>
