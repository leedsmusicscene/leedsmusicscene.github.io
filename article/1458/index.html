The 15 bands, from all over the city, have the opportunity to perform live in the Town Hall in three unique gigs, showing off not only their talent but also the amazing diversity of the Leeds music scene.<br><br>Opening the series of gigs on Wednesday March 12 were The Couderhae Connection, Amelia & Me, Rhode Island, Blake and solo artist, Lemont Sylvester.<br><br>Wednesday March 19 sees Blackout Band, Sly Mr Fox, The Midnight Shoppers, Conrad and Dr Strangemoose line up together, whilst the Crypt will welcome The 42 Tones, Samsa, All Its Worth, Exit and Solo the week after.<Br><br>Jon Price, Bright Young Things Organiser said, "All the bands have tremendous talent and have really developed during BYT. The three gigs are a great chance for the bands to put into practise the new abilities they have gained in the studios."
