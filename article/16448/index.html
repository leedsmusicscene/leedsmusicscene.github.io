    <p>Hi, we are All For Glory a five piece Rock band from Wakefield, West-Yorkshire, England. We formed late January under the name 'Tangled Delay' but after a much agreed change we became 'All For Glory'. Becki Baxendale, our current singer joined the band in March 2012 and fit straight in making her the All For Glory Front woman!<br />We had our Debut gig Headlining Middlestown WMC which received support from our good friends Wakefield Rock band, Red Light Riot. Since our first gig we have had many bookings including venues such as The Hop, Snooty Fox and many more local places and we hope to add more to the list. We bring many influences to the stage, we are influenced by pop-punk bands such as Paramore, Green Day and All Time Low but then by more hard rock bands such as Evanescence, Halestorm and Lacuna Coil. As individuals we all listen to many genres, some more than others. Common bands that are among our favourites as a group are; Metallica, Trivium, Guns N Roses and Evanescence and Nickelback. <br />More recently we have been experimenting with different genres in and around Rock trying to find them catchy Riffs, mind blowing drums beats and catchy face melting vocal sections which will get the crowd going. Our plan for the rest of 2012 is to get ourselves out there and gain more fans by playing gigs with a variety of different bands from different genres, Ending the year with some writing and recording!<br /><br />Members:<br />Becki Baxendale - Lead Vocals<br />Tony Green - Bass Guitar, Backing Vocals<br />Luke Taylor - Lead Guitar, Backing Vocals<br />Neil Penn - Rhythm Guitar<br />Kieran Gotts - Drums.</p>
