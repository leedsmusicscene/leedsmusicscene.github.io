        <h1>The Cribs - Martell</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Martell" recorded by The Cribs. The review was written by Rachel Glover in 2005.</p>
    <p>The third offering from our very own Wakefield trio’s second album ‘The New Fellas’ is yet another slice of charming indie pop responsible for securing the hype surrounding the so-called ‘New Yorkshire’ movement at the moment.  Featuring the seemingly obligatory chorus of ‘woah-oh-ohs’ just waiting to be echoed, be it either in a drunken love-in fashion down at your local indie club or dancing around your bedroom purely appreciating music, youth and freedom, there is no escaping the feel-good factor of the fabulously catchy ‘Martell’.  And this is despite its apparent digs at the city the rest of the music world seems to be celebrating, ‘your precious Leeds is dead...’ Erm, really? Someone better tell the NME...<br><br>Endearingly simple, The Cribs have once again provided us with a sing-a-long classic, with its immediate bouncy beats and Ryan’s effortless vocals conveying their blatant cockiness, it is hardly the ground-breaking stuff which can be found on offer elsewhere in Leeds (¡...!) but the Jarman boys appear not to be trying to change the face of music but rather just make it that little more enjoyable and give us something else to bounce around and spill our vodka to on a Friday night.</p>
