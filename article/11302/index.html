    </div>
    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2009.</p>
    <p>Leeds solo artist Jon Gomm has this week announced the release of this new album – titled ‘Don’t Panic’ – which is the follow up to his 2003 debut album ‘Hypertension’.<br><br>The album is released on 7th December 2009 via the Performing Chimp Records label.<br><br>‘Don’t Panic’ exhibits Jon’s genuine grasp of a wide range of genres from blues to jazz to rock to country, which comes from his lifelong experience as a session musician and musical academic. Throw in some Urdu lyrics and you’re getting the picture – a one man melting pot.<br><br>Jon Gomm has an incredible virtuoso guitar style, where he uses one acoustic guitar to create drum sounds, bass lines and sparkling melodies all at the same time. As with the debut album, there are no overdubs on ‘Don’t Panic’, although it may sound like it: there is never more than one guitar on every track.<br><br>The album will be available on CD from Amazon and from Jon’s official website, and as a Digital Download from iTunes and other leading download sites.<br><br>Jon will be playing live at the Brudenell Social Club on 4th December 2009 - tickets for the album launch party are available now from We Got Tickets.</p>
