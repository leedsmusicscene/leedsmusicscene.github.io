        <h1>Unsigned Leeds band to play live on ITV "Late Attitude" show...</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2004.</p>
    <p>FineApple will appear on the ITV "Late Attitude" show presented by Richard Alexander as a follow up to their participation in Bright Young Things.<br><br>The Late Attitude show is an opportunity for people to express their opinions on current affairs. For the next show which will be filmed in Leeds, the members of FineApple have been asked to talk about the British music industry and manufactured music, before doing a live performance. The show will be aired Thursday 1st April at 11:30pm on ITV1 (in the Yorkshire region only).<br><br>Drummer Tom Almas said, "The live music scene is bursting at the seams with talent, yet all we ever hear on the radio is talentless manufactured pop rubbish. This is a topic which we feel really strongly about, as do the hundreds of other bands out there who are slogging their guts out, only to see yet another boy band on Top of The Pops.  Hopefully this will be the first of many opportunities for proper bands to speak up".</p>
