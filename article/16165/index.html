Still with the gig guide for the forthcoming week, and still having local music news and a fresh unheard song in every edition you can now catch the Local Music Update during John Tolson's Saturday morning show at approximately 10.30am.<br /><br />Ridings FM Presenter John Tolson said: "We're committed to supporting local music and helping new talent come through".<br /><br />"We're always looking at how we can play a greater role in our community and this seemed like an excellent step forward".  <br /><br />Ridings FM broadcasts on 106.8 FM.<br /><br />Any solo artists, duos or bands who would like to be featured on the Local Music Update should send material and information to:<br /><br />Andy Philpott, <br />Local Music Update, <br />106.8 Ridings FM, <br />Unit 7, <br />Network Centre, <br />Zenith Park, <br />Whaley Road, <br />Barnsley, <br />S75 1HT <br /><br />You can email Andy via andyphilpott [ at ] fsmail.net</p>
