    <p>Brett Lee is set to release the first single from his second EP, after the successful release of his first EP 'For The Taking' back in 2013, which received plaudits from the music press, regular radio play and was championed by BBC Introducing.<br /><br />Titled 'When We Were Young', the single will be released on Friday 26th June, and will be available via Spotify and major digital stores, including Bandcamp. This single is the lead track from his long-awaited second EP, which is due for release in October.<br /><br />To celebrate the single release, Brett Lee will be playing a launch show at 360 Club, at The Library in Leeds on Saturday 13th June. <br /><br />After a successful debut solo EP, which led to a Live Session on BBC Introducing, Brett Lee made it back into the studio, working alongside Liam Stokes at Elmaroe Production.<br /><br />Brett Lee told us "It was fantastic to work with Liam Stokes again, he is a very talented musician and producer. We have very similar styles in writing, so the finished product always sounds exactly how it should be. 'When We Were Young' carries forward the honesty in my music from the last EP, but also shows maturity in my music. This really is my best work so far."<br /><br />The new single is jam-packed with Brett Lee's honest style in writing music, catchy riffs and meaningful lyrics. Brett stuck to his winning formula of writing music that people can relate to. There is always a meaning to every song.</p>
