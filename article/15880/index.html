    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2011.</p>
    <p>Leeds based 360 Club which is rapidly becoming one of the UK's most respected live music events, showcases the very best in up and coming acts, whilst also assisting them with music industry advice and guidance, having seen several of its bands feature at Glastonbury, Leeds and Reading festivals this year as well as extensive coverage on BBC Introducing and Radio 1 play list being achieved for one act working with 360 Club's founder Richard Watson, the well respected gig night has had a very exciting year so far.<br /><br />Martin House Children's Hospice is an organisation that Watson has an enormous amount of respect for in light of the wonderful work they do for young people and their families so, he has decided that 360 Clubs Christmas gig will be in aid of Martin House with ALL the profits to be donated to the charity.<br /><br />Richard told us "I first became aware of this Martin House Children's Hospice via a fundraising event they run called 'Centre Stage' which is a competition for young bands with the final held at the Academy in Leeds with the winners getting to play Leeds Festival. So I looked at Martin House and what they did and was truly moved by what they do and the people they help, it's a beautiful thing that they do so, I wanted to give some help in my own small way, it's for this reason I am giving them the profits from my Christmas gig, Christmas is a time for children and families so it was a no brainer to be honest especially when you think of what a hospice is for. I would ask anybody to take a look at what they do and support them where possible"<br /><br />"This gig which is on Friday 23rd December is being recorded & Filmed for BBC Introducing West Yorkshire & BBC Big Screens, Alan Raw (BBC Introducing) is DJ'ing the event and any bands/ artists who bring a demo will get them played during his set.<br /><br /> "All my 360 Club gigs feature high quality line-ups starring local acts, a lot of the bands that play could easily be signed and go on to bigger and better things, there's some awesome talent around and, this gig on the 23rd of December is a cracking line-up which will see the return of Leeds' very own 'Sound of Sirens' and will also feature 'Apollo's Basement', 'The Canolas' and 'El Cartel', so I am very excited"<br /><br />'Sound of Sirens'  have spent the last two years building up a reputation as a stellar live band. they deliver an exciting blend of indie, rock and electro, which has proved popular with their fast growing fanbase. They've  performed all over the U.K, and  had significant radio play. Having  completed their UK tour they took an extended break to work on new material and to bring in a new member, Ryan on synth. With the new line-up came a new sound, the band moving away from its indie roots to a more electro rock. with a brand new set of material written and ready to gig, they're looking to hit the ground running and capitalize on their growing popularity.<br /><br />360 Club's Christmas gig certainly looks like a superb night, so if you're a fan of live music and looking for a quality night out on the 23rd, look no further.<br /><br />To follow 360 Club visit the facebook page at:  www.facebook.com/360Club</p>
