    <p>A number of Leeds bands and musicians are to appear in Harrogate in July as part of Harrogate International Festival Fringe. The event will take place over a number of weeks, from Wednesday 14th July through to Saturday 31st July 31.<br /><br />The event is being organised by Graham Chalmers, who has strong musical connections to Leeds. Not only has he taken the best musical exports from Leeds to play small bars in Harrogate, he was also instrumental in charting the rise of the music scene in the 90s through the popular local music 'zine Charm. The Leeds Music Scene editorial were huge fans of Charm, and this site was originally inspired by it. <br /><br />Selected highlights from the event include an evening with Field Music at Harrogate Theatre with support from AMPS Awards finalists, local teenage guitar band The Weeknights and Simon Wainwright of Leeds band Hope & Social.<br /><br />On Saturday, 24th July, David Procter (former Charm contributor and current Leeds Music Scene writer) will take part in Fear of Music at The Club along with David Stubbs (Melody Maker, Guardian).<br /><br />The following Saturday, July 31st, sees the Fringe Crawl Indie Day, with the Fringe taking over five town centre venues for an entire day. Sixty bands from Harrogate, Leeds, York and beyond will appear between noon and 4am.<br /><br />A small selection from the Leeds bands appearing includes Honour Before Glory, Alvin Purple, Arthur Rigby & the Baskervylles, and Fran Rodgers. <br /><br />As well as the music, there's also photography. On Friday, July 23rd, RedHouse Originals will present Music to my Eyes: a Rock n Roll exhibition featuring artwork by Sir Peter Blake (The Beatles/Ian Dury), Aubrey Powell (Led Zeppelin), Storm Thorgerson (Pink Floyd) and more.<br /><br />This is just a taster.
