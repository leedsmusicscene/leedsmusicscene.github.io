        <h1>Avoca - Untitled</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Untitled" recorded by Avoca. The review was written by Simon Glacken in 2005.</p>
    <p>Formed around six months this Leeds based outfit have managed to pull together a 4-track demo, which features tracks taken from their usual set list. Immediately a schoolboy error has taken place due to the lack of a tracklisting.<br><Br>Versatile is a word that could be attached to this band quite rightly. Their music slips and slides between a mixture of blues, soul, jazz and funk but maintains a very laidback feel, while the vocal exchanges between the band’s two female singers add yet more variety to their music.<br><br>The problem I’m starting to have is that Avoca’s music is at times a little too laidback, a little too quiet, except for the odd minimalist explosion of guitar freakishness that occasionally surfaces. If I were to lay back any more I’d be in danger of falling asleep where I’d start to dream that the band were playing in a wine bar somewhere in Leeds or supporting Simply Red, both of which would be a horrendously bad thing.<br><br>But for an act that have only been together for half a year they do have a solid music base to work from but they can only go forward if they move their music up a gear or three.</p>
