        <h1>Kaylium - Untitled</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Untitled" recorded by Kaylium. The review was written by Nick Kearns in 2005.</p>
    <p>Hmmm, interesting. On first inspection Kaylium seem to be one to file under the “decent, but not a band to get your knickers in a twist over” section. However, the “repeat” button on one's CD player can sometimes be a wonderful thing. After about the fourth or fifth listen the riffs and hooks fall start to fall into place, and suddenly the whole affair seems a whole lot more appealing.<br><br>Taking their cue from brooding riff-orientated metal merchants such as Helmet or early Tool, the overall sound here is dark. That’s dark as in eating a bar of Bourneville down a coal mine whilst listening to Metallica’s Black album dark. Sludgy downtuned guitars are the order of the day, along with edgy stop/start drumming and a powerful female vocal.<br><br>Of the three songs closer “Broken Edge” is probably the strongest here; building from a neat little guitar hook that’s almost Perfect Circle-esque the song bounds along with an almost punky swagger and showcases a confident and catchy chorus.<br><br>Overall, good points are the ballsy guitar riffs, vocal delivery and the solid songwriting. In terms of improving things from a recording perspective the bass is generally a bit quiet at the expense of the vocals, some parts could be a tad tighter and all three songs have a similar structure in terms of how they develop. Are any of these major concerns? Not at all. As a debut CD for a young band it provides a solid base from which new ideas and techniques can come to fruition. A good start.</p>
