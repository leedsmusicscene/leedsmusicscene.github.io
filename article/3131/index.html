    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for Portal.</p>
    <p>The project of UK-based multi-instrumentalist Scott Sinfield and vocalist Rachel Hughes, Portal have had more than 25 releases on labels such as Earworm, Awkward Silence, Alice-in-Wonder, Rocket Racer and Enraptured since their debut in 1998.  In 2002, they established the musical collective and independent record label Make Mine Music as a co-operative venture with other like-minded artists (yellow6, July Skies, Avrocar... )<br><bR>Portal began as the name given to Scott's 4-track home recordings, influenced by the likes of My Bloody Valentine, Cocteau Twins, Brian Eno and Kraftwerk.  Rachel joined in 1999 and the music evolved over time, being described along the way as "bridging the gap between electronica and post-rock" and "relaxing yet oddly disturbing".  Since the release of their second album "Promise" in 2003, Portal have developed their methods of writing and recording using sampling, sound manipulation and digital editing.  They have sought to blend the creative freedom and experimentation provided by laptop sequencing and digital processing with the more traditional elements of melody and structure associated with song-based music.<br><br>Most recently, Portal contributed a track to the Misplaced Music CD "Misplaced Pets".  A new Portal album "Waves and Echoes" will be released in 2005 on Make Mine Music..</p>
