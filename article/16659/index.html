    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for The Rose of Avalanche.</p>
    <p>Formed during 1984, in Leeds, England by founding members Phil Morris, Paul James Berry and Alan Davis. The name came from the "rose" for the beauty and the "avalanche" for the power, as a way of describing their music. The Rose of Avalanche quickly found recognition for their song writing ability. <br /><br />Before they had played a gig they signed to local independent label LiL, and released two singles: "LA Rain" and "Goddess". Both made Number 1 in the UK Independent Chart, with "LA Rain" also featuring in John Peel's (the legendary Radio1 DJ) Festive 50 in 1985. <br /><br />After this initial success, Fire Records signed the band and the personnel changed. The "classic" line up was now Phil Morris, Paul James Berry, Glenn Schultz, Nicol McKay, and Mark Thompson. "Mass market" exposure came with the support slot on The Mission's 1986/87 World Crusade Tour. This line up released a further five singles and the first official studio album - "Never Another Sunset" in 1989. <br /><br />Shultz and McKay left the band in 1989, and new bass player Darren Horner was recruited to replace McKay. This line up released one EP "A Peace Inside". Further personal changes occurred in 1990 with Thompson leaving to be replaced by Andy Porter. The final line up then delivered one EP and two Albums "String A Beads" in 1990, and "ICE" in 1991. The band split in 1992..</p>
