        <h1>Relentless Stage line-up revealed for Leeds Festival 2015</h1>

    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2015.</p>
    <p>Known as the latest and loudest stage at Leeds Festival, the Relentless Stage returns for 2015 with another mega party line-up. Headlining each night are leading names in dance and electronic music, including Bondax, Mau5trap Presents Special Guests, DJ EZ and Modestep (DJ set).<br /><br />The Relentless Stage continues the party vibe as it has done in previous years, with music kicking off from 8pm every night going straight through until 3am. The eponymous 3-d image mapped stage is back in the same location, nestled amongst the trees, between the Orange and Red campsites.<br /><br />Kicking off the first night of the festival in style is none other than electronic duo Bondax, backed by Fono, and Relentless's Here to be Heard DJ competition 2014 winner, Luke Hassan.<br /><br />Ravers should get to the Relentless Stage early on Friday night for an incredible line-up presented by Mau5trap featuring some very special guest appearances. Watch this space...<br /><br />Saturday night will be a showcase of London talent, with garage legend, DJ EZ, showing us why he's still king of the festival party. He will be supported by Rinse FM regular, Oneman, and NTS's record maker, player and mixer, Martelo.<br /><br />There's no let up on Sunday, the final night, as London-based dubstep and electronic rock band Modestep take to the stage with a late-night DJ set. He will be backed by electronic / dubstep favourite Culprate as well as this year's Relentless's yet-to-be-decided Here to be Heard DJ competition winner.</p>
