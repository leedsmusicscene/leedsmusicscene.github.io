        <h1>Shut Your Eyes And You'll Burst Into Flames - Signal Noise</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Signal Noise" recorded by Shut Your Eyes And You'll Burst Into Flames. The review was written by Luke Ramsden in 2006.</p>
    <p>Already a mainstay and one of the most immediate and sublime highlights of Leeds' very own 10 legged, triple afro adorned post-punk 5 piece Shut Your Eyes And You'll Burst Into Flames' ever staggeringly good live shows, it's not a shock that ‘Signal Noise' is the opening shot of what could be a very special musical journey indeed.<br><br>Probably the most unashamedly poppy number from SYEAYBIF's repertoire, those familiar with Dance To The Radio mark 2's Shut Your Eyes… cut - ‘Amputee Smile' will no doubt recognise how ‘Signal Noise' is going to unravel from the off. A driving beat leads the way through a quagmire of perpetually stalling and shuddering guitar bursts with the 2nd guitar providing the dance element that makes Shut Your Eyes And You'll Burst Into Flames so very special. The continual re-iteration of “We're getting faster, keep getting faster” and “Keep dancing, we'll get there in the end” absolutely sum the record up to a tee. That's the song's mission statement and that's sure as hell what it delivers.<br><br>B-side ‘Kingdom Of Goats' is an all together different kettle of…um… goats?<br><br>Random lyrical content aside this is pure, unadulterated thrash metal that the likes of Whores, Whores, Whores and Concentration Champ have made their own locally. The Shut Your Eyes And You'll Burst Into Flames overriding feel is still there but with lead vocals controlled by guitarist Dave, he adds a whole new level of ferociousness and visceral energy to proceedings that is a very interesting asset to call on when required.<br><br>And in just over 4 minutes, Shut Your Eyes And You'll Burst Into Flames will surely wake many more up to their unique brand of energetic post-punk hardcore skulduggery. You won't be able to resist for much longer.</p>
