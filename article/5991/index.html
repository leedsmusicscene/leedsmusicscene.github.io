    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Ringway to Seatac" recorded by The Wedding Present. The review was written by Richard Garnett in 2005.</p>
    <p>The Ringway in question is Manchester airport and charts Gedge’s final moments with his ex as he is destined to fly stateside. It was one of the big highlights of this year's “comeback” album Take Fountain and it seems Gedge’s own self confessed love of the single format may just have finally got the better of him as a question of necessity seems to hang over this release. The main song is a beauty with its neat switch between fast driving punk and soaring grinding grunge. Sadly the same can’t be said for B-sides, Shivers and American Tan, the former sounding like a weak Cinerama cast off and the latter feeling like an unfinished studio idea. If you’ve heard Ringway To Seatac and liked it then buy the album as this is strictly for the hardcore.</p>
