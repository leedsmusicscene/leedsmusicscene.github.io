    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for In Between Echoes.</p>
    <p>Since they formed in 2011 these four Leeds lads have shared a dedication and drive to create masterful music blending tonal clarity and nuance with the power and majesty of driven amplifiers. Their infectious energy is captured best by their uncompromising live performances.<br /><br />Members of the band can often be seen busking in Leeds city centre in order to promote their own original material.<br /><br />James Debroy (vocals) and Rob Orange (guitar) met in 2010 through a mutual passion for music. It was soon apparent that their styles and taste in music held a distinctive crossover. Ten original tracks later Adam Greenhead (Bass) and Nic Deiana (Drum) were brought into the fold lending their innate ability to provide extra pace, volume, impact and energy. The four of them combine to produce a raw and edgy sound that's not only dynamic and funk driven but warm and naturally soulful. A 5 track EP "Breeze on By" was soon created featuring the tracks Morning Light, Bring it Down and Slip Away. The music has kept developing with Clarity and Tangled State evidence of their evolving vision. <br /><br />Their music was soon noticed and their singles Morning Light and Breeze on By have been played on BBC Radio Leeds and York followed swiftly by a live performance as featured artists on BBC Introducing. <br /> <br />'Some fine musical writing' Leeds Music Scene <br /><br />'This band sounds absolutely beautiful, The lead singers voice utterly blew me away, New Age Blues if you will' Jenny Eells, BBC.<br /><br />'A fine Yorkshire Band' Alan Raw, BBC..</p>
