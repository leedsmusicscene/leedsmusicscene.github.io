    <p>The Seagulls have announced 27th July 2015 as the release date for their highly anticipated debut album, Desert Eleven, via Sandtrap Records. Desert Eleven is their first full-length album release since 2014's 'Parachute' EP and its lead single, 'Girl You Must Be Dreaming'.  <br /><br />In support of the album, on Saturday 25th July there will be a release party held at the 360 Club at The Library, with pre-release signed copies of the album available.  <br /><br />Tickets are available to purchase at Leeds Gig Tickets.<br /><br />The album will be available to pre-order from all good digital download stores.  <br /><br />You can also catch The Seagulls at an exclusive in store performance at Crash Records on Thursday 23rd July at 6pm.  <br /><br />Dom Richmond, lead vocals for The Seagulls says of Desert Eleven, "We started making this record around two years ago in a basement in Leeds, tracking a few drums as demos. We really wanted to keep that live, raw sound so most of what you can hear on this album is from those original sessions. The record has a very foreign, tropical vibe to it hence the name and without giving too much away it has a bit of a concept behind it." <br /><br />Details of a summer UK tour will be released in the coming weeks.<br /><br />Watch 'Girl You Must Be Dreaming' here:<br /><br /><iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/crJWaSReyRo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
