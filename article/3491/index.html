        <h1>The Bilderberg Group - This City!</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "This City!" recorded by The Bilderberg Group. The review was written by Holden DeForge in 2005.</p>
    <p>A burst of harmonised vocals introduces this latest single from The Bilderberg Group, "This City". A jaunty, jangly guitar rhythm is the song's foundations whilst a swirl of organ sweeps below those rich vocals. There are some nice breaks in the song as the tempo drops before everything picks up and carries you away again. It's not really my cup of tea but still pleasant enough, it's almost like an NME-ised Barenaked Ladies in that it's catchy but sometimes sacrifices that for the sake of quirkiness. That makes sense to me. If it doesn't to you then you'll most likely enjoy this.<bR><br>"Live Music" sounds like Franz Ferdinand to me. That's not a good thing. It's well played, well put together and actually more listenable than anything the latest flavour of the week have delivered. However, it has the same fast slow structure as the first track, the sound of a good idea being overused. That's a theme that repeats itself on the third track. The lyrics are great and catch the ear immediately "Feel so weak cos I work all week and a working week doesn't work for me, cos I work at weekends week on week and I can't work out when the week ends". That's fantastic!! I love it. But alas, the entire remainder of the song is based around the same organ riff and those same lyrics repeated, over and over and over and over again. What a waste, what a waste.</p>
