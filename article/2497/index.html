    <p>Making timeless music is difficult and important. You may not fully understand how or why bands make such music, maybe you don’t even care.<br><br>Immune makes timeless music. An unearthly movement, that only after repeated listens begins to take shape. Not that these sounds are not immediate, some things just take more time and require a little more effort.<br><Br>Reference points musically could head towards Brainiac, Massive Attack, Tool or the later work of Sneaker Pimps, but to compare Immune to others does it a huge disservice - everyone needs to feel loved... <Br><br>Formed in early 2002 and currently based in Leeds, UK, Immune has wrapped itself up in its own world. The independent ethic owned by Immune has resulted in Gizeh Records (a label set-up and run by the band with members of Glissando), web/art design and putting on shows in and around the Leeds area. <br><br>2004 saw the release of ‘Elek’, a 3 track EP recorded and mixed by Immune in their own studio.<br><bR>It put Immune and Gizeh on the impossible musical map. Immune's debut album '1/f' is released through Gizeh Recordings in April 2006..</p>
