    <p>The legendary charity all dayer, Quidrophenia returned to Oporto last week, teaming up with Milo's Bar to offer the best in Bank Holiday music. <br /><br />With two venues and more than 30 acts, Quidrophenia raised over £500 for Cancer Research UK. The charitable all-dayer, now onto its twelfth event, has raised thousands of pounds for charity over the past five years.<br /><br />The mammoth 12 hour charity event has played host to 100s of amazing acts including The Pigeon Detectives, Ellen & Escapades, Jack Afro, Micky P Kerr, Rose Elinor Dougall and many more!<br /><br />This year's Quidrophenia was so huge it had to expand to live music bar Milo's to occupy the number of bands, DJs and acoustic acts. With only £2 entry fee (donated to Cancer Research UK) both venues were packed with music fans, jumping around to the likes of Wingman, Secret Circuits, Dinosaur Pile Up and Machine Guns & Leather Jackets.<br /><br />The day's highlights included Jonny Firth playing 2 sets in both bars, whilst Mojo 57 got everyone dancing on the Gaslight Stage in Oporto. Harry Johns had 2 amazing performances, smashing up Milo's with Machine Guns & Leather Jackets then later performing with Wingman in Oporto.<br /><br />Founder of Quidrophenia, Mark Crossley said; "It was nice to see both bars pulling together and merging regular acts with newcomers. I'm really looking forward to the next one and making Quidrophenia grow and grow. It's a lot of hard work and when organising Quid and I always promise myself I'll never do another until the day comes and I remember how much fun it actually is. Great bands, great people and great times. Building Memories".<br /><br />Be sure to get down to Oporto every Monday night from 7.30pm for free live music presented by The Gaslight Club.</p>
