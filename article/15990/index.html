    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for Cotton Club.</p>
    <p>A collaboration of like-minded musicians dissatisfied and nullified by the over-saturated indie scene, Cotton Club's music is a wistful blend of Funk and Soul with a twist of Blues, Rock and Hip Hop. Jennie Kecic's sultry vocals are delivered with passion and maturity; bassist Dan Kudelnitzky and drummer Chris Holdsworth share an unspoken bond, a mutual understanding of rhythm and groove; and Adam East's punctuated guitar chords cut through the mix. All essential elements to a sound that is catchy, lean, and oozes with confidence.<br />With a refined, sophisticated sound and an arsenal of finely crafted songs, the band has impressed audiences and critics alike, garnering favourable reviews along the way.<br />The band has made notable headway on the live scene, bringing their rapturous live show to many venues across Yorkshire and further afield. Key events include performing at BBC Introducing...'s 360 Club in Leeds, and reaching the final of the Empire Battle of the Bands. Since then, they have gone from strength to strength, headlining both the Mustardstock Festival 2012 and the Republic Fashion Annual Conference, in front of a 500+ audience.<br />Cotton Club has released two singles to date, 'On A Promise' and 'Manchester Rain'. Both singles were recorded in 2011 with producer Matt Peel at Cottage Road Studio (Pigeon Detectives, Pulled Apart By Horses, The Crookes). The band is poised to enter The Soundmill with producer Si McGrath to record a brand new EP, set for release in 2013..</p>
