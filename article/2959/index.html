        <h1>Colin Mounsey - The Hungry Pig EP</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "The Hungry Pig EP" recorded by Colin Mounsey. The review was written by Sam Saunders in 2004.</p>
    <p>This vintage quality EP has five full-bodied songs from Colin Mounsey (aka The Hungry Pig). Colin is a recent solo arrival in Leeds as a fully-formed songwriter and performer with a lavish sense of musical adventure, having served time with Blue Planet and Anabasis.<br><br>You might catch echoes of David Bowie, Mercury Rev or Nick Cave. It's the maturity and subtlety that does that.<br><br>The basic palette is a classically-inclined and carefully considered piano with bass, drums, synthesised strings and electronic noise as required. Mounsey's voice, solo or piled up in harmonising layers, is a convincing wistful tenor with accuracy, confidence and no histrionics. Sponge Studios have done a fine job on blending it all together.<br><br>So what does it taste like?<br><br>"Drinking" sets off in mournful spirits. A gently coaxing piano and careful drumming make it romantic and defiant by turns. "I'll be gone by the time she wakes" leaves it resigned and strong.<br><br>"The girl who played God" uses the studio's slightly out of tune acoustic piano and some scary atmospheric noises to achieve that so-difficult effect of a final song that leaves an agreeable aftertaste and opens out our expectations for even more exciting things for the future. It's vividly evocative - forcing the imagination to sketch out a screenplay, a set, some people ... excellent.<br><br>In between we have "Society", "How is your Soul" and "Chase the Dragon". "Society" has an 80's pop-intelligentsia feel, with "the price is right" jammed into a busy lyric. The slick performance has light echoes of Sparks, Squeeze and Joe Jackson. It's an elegant and complex song with a slow choir-like section that leads to a big piano and strings ending. "How is your Soul" covers the spiritual side of things, with a neatly off-beat and outsider feel. "Chase the Dragon" isn't Magnum, no chance ... but it has a subtle and anxious darkness to put up against the black anger of the Beast of Bourbon's song of the same name.<br><br>This is a very impressive debut release. Another serious talent to slot in alongside Vib Gyor perhaps. </p>
