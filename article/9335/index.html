    <p>Leeds based pop group Heads We Dance will be releasing their eagerly anticipated debut single on April 28th! The single will 'Love In The Digital Age' b/w 'Work It Out' and will be coming out on hot new label Lost In Paris, home to Bolt Action Five and Adam Kesher.<br><br>This year Heads We Dance have been named by Popbitch as their 'new favourite band', were described as 'one to watch 2008' by This Is Fake DIY and have been a MySpace featured artist. They are also garnering a reputation as a band with a knack of spotting top remixing talent early; having had 'Love In The Digital Age' remixed by Tepr (Wall of Sound/Kitsune) and Frankmusik (just remixed Alphabeat/signed to Island) for a limited edition white label released late last year.<br><br>Heads We Dance are an exciting new band with feet planted firmly in both Pop and Electro camps. Both songs and remixes are available to hear now on their MySpace.</p>
