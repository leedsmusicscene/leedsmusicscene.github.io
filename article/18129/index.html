        <h1>Post War Glamour Girls announce debut album 'Pink Fur'</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2013.</p>
    <p>Post War Glamour Girls have announced the release of their debut ten track LP 'Pink Fur' on February 14th 2014, along with two exciting launch shows in Leeds and London. <br /><br />Described as being reminiscent of The Birthday Party with vocals evocative of Nick Cave crossed with Frank Black (if they both hailed from Leeds), Post War Glamour Girls have spent the past two years building up an impressive body of work, showcasing their innate knack for creating intricately layered and intelligent compositions with an almost theatrical Arcade Fire-like build up. <br /><br />And while the mainstream has noticed, with the band already receiving heavy support from DIY, Clash, being invited to perform on the NME/BBC Radio 1 stages at Reading and Leeds festivals in 2012, as well as playing the main stage at Beacons Festival, it's the incredible amount of underground fan-driven support that has marked Post War Glamour Girls out as a band to watch in 2014. <br /><br />Having sold out of their debut 7" single 'Ode to Harry Dean/ Spitting Pearls' and their initial EP 'Tragic Loss; he had such a lovely house', the band continued 2013 with a series of lauded shows at Live at Leeds and Long Division, tour supports with both PINS and I Like Trains, as well as performing to over 800 people at Leeds University Stylus. <br /><br />Everything has been leading to this moment with the band announcing the release of their expansive and epic ten-track debut album, 'Pink Fur', on Valentines Day of next year. Recorded in break neck speed with Lee Smith and Jamie Lockhart (The Cribs, Forward Russia) at Greenmount Studios, 'Pink Fur' will be pressed onto CD and vinyl, along with a limited edition of 100 pink records in honour of the band's title. <br /><br />Never short of theatrics, the band will be performing their album in full at the Brudenell Social Club in Leeds on February 13th, with additional special guests plus a choir consisting of members of Heart-Ships, Witch Hunt, and Sam Airey.<br /><br />Tickets can be bought for the launch from Leeds Gig Tickets.</p>
