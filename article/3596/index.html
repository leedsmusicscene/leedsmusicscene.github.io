        <h1>Whole Sky Monitor - Just Let Me Talk To her</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Just Let Me Talk To her" recorded by Whole Sky Monitor. The review was written by Richard Garnett in 2005.</p>
    <p>Whole Sky Monitor's biog describes them as "Northern existential kitchen sink dramatists" but as no-one has any idea (or cares) what that means, time to try listening to the music. At times sounding like a lo-fi Manic Street Preachers with the vocals of those other welsh rockers The 60ft Dolls, this is an album of familiar sounding Indie. Eleven (well 10) tracks that occasionally throw out a gem or two but it's really only for the persistent listener.<BR><BR>In general the catchy-ometer is rarely troubled and the one-paced song style and lack of variation in sound is sure to leave the casual listener cold. At times it's hard work, especially combined with the flat formulaic 2 stroke method John Parkes uses for delivering his vocals: (1) The reading back of a statement or (2) the shouted statement.<Br><Br>Despite this, WSM show regular glimpses of talent and touch with songs like the superb "Be Beautiful" or the Doves-esque pounding of "Basic Rock Song". The transition of any band from EP to LP can be a tricky one and keeping the quality going through out in this case proves one step too much.</p>
