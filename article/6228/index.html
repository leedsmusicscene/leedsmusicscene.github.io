    <p class="lead">This is a review of "When Machines Hit Back" recorded by Electric Street Police. The review was written by Matthew Walton in 2006.</p>
    <p>Are you one of those people who used to be into the dance scene but then drifted slowly but surely into the indie revolution? I know I am, dance was my first love, and it will be my last. As much as I like the wealth of new talent, Kaisers, Arctic monkeys, Editors etc. etc. dance is still running through my veins, but until now I hadn’t found an accomplice to provide the intravenous drip needed to extract my hidden feelings. Step forward Electric Street Police and their first offering “When Machines Hit Back”.<br><br>The name is captivating, the graphics intriguing and the composition groundbreaking. These ingredients all mix together incredibly well, resulting in a dance orientated, distinctive tune that combines string breakdowns of epic proportions, mixed with a beat that as Sonny and Cher so rightly said, would go on and on. If marks were given out on this song alone then a definite five stars were on offer, however, as my last girlfriend recently told me, things started off so well and then went down hill.<br><br>The next two songs are, like losing your virginity, a bit of a letdown. After such a blinding introduction the tempo drops to tunes not easily embraced and a little too mellow and bland. According to ESP’s website, they aim their tracks at “advertising/promotional purposes and film/video games as soundtracks”. I suppose the tunes could work in those domains, but as an effort aimed at the listening public, best left alone.<br><br>In conclusion, plenty of potential, they just need to concentrate on one market, in my opinion the faster dance floor tunes.</p>
