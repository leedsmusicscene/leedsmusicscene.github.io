    <p>What does it mean to be British?<br /><br /><br />It may well be the double decker buses and Cricket that sum up this fair isle.<br /><br /><br />Kitsch. Harmless. Boring.<br /><br /><br />or...<br /><br /><br />It could be the thug abroad... Flag tattooed to his teeth; won't eat that foreign muck.<br /><br /><br />or...<br /><br /><br />It could be Moody Gowns.<br /><br /><br />Moody Gowns are a band who are quintessentially British for all the right reasons. They champion that wry wit and charm that all of history's greatest Brits possessed. They couple it with light-hearted cynicism that is undeniably funny. They don't take themselves too seriously; yet they are more real, true to life and down right important than any other band on your radar right now.<br /><br /><br />They are one of a kind.<br /><br /><br />Brought together by one Nathan Moseley back in 2008, Moody Gowns are an abrasive bunch of art-poppers destined to steal the heart of every true music fan on the planet.<br /><br /><br />If you don't get it... Get out.<br /><br /><br />Songs are typically topical. Whether its about the bane of the bus driver and his refusal to smile (Misery Guts), the struggle and strife of being the powerless new comer in a tight knit household (Stepmother), or the grand scale of just about everything... Sex (Dreaming), Religion (Don't Let The Church Stop You), Money (Mr. Money), Moody Gowns are a band with something worth saying.<br /><br /><br />Whilst being one of around five bands on earth that can actually claim they sound like no one else, comparisons and relations can be drawn to the likes of: The Divine Comedy, Ian Dury and The Blockheads, Stanley Holloway, Talking Heads, Eels, The Fall and Mr Bungle.<br /><br /><br />To date, their discography includes two EPs (Snakes and Horses / Sincerely Yours) and a single (Mr. Money) recorded with James Kenosha (Pulled Apart By Horses, Grammatics). Support slots have included fellow art-punks Everything Everything and the likes of King Charles and Chew Lips.<br /><br /><br />James Smith.</p>
