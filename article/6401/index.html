    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2006.</p>
    <p>Mean Fiddler, promoters of the annual Leeds Festival have joined forces with Trees For Cities and Leeds City Council this year to further demonstrate their commitment to the West Yorkshire environment.<br><br>The collaboration will see new trees and a hedgerow planted in the Leeds area and on routes approaching the Leeds Festival site at Bramham Park (A6120, South Leeds Stadium, Meynell Approach and Swinnow Lane). In addition, a new hedgerow will be planted at Holbeck Moor.<Br><br>The aim of all parties involved is to give something back to the residents of the Leeds area and to show Mean Fiddler’s commitment to the area and their intent to work with the council and local community for the benefit of all.<br><br>Melvin Benn, Managing Director of Mean Fiddler Festivals said, "After being introduced to Trees For Cities as an organisation in late 2004, it was clear to me that their aims and desires fit my own and my team’s aims here at Mean Fiddler so much, that offering to produce an event for them as a gift was a no brainer. A very successful first outing for a 5km charity run was an activity introduction that I am sure will last a long time as will the trees that we are planting here in Leeds and also in Reading. It is our pleasure to be associated with and to contribute to such a worthwhile and long lasting activity.”<br><br>Leeds Festival 2006 takes place over the August Bank Holiday weekend. Announcements on its line up and the availability of tickets for the event are expected to be made in early April - keep checking www.leedsmusicfestival.com for all the latest Leeds Festival 2006 news.</p>
