        <h1>Kaiser Chiefs - Oh My God</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Oh My God" recorded by Kaiser Chiefs. The review was written by Dave Sugden in 2004.</p>
    <p>The debut single from Kaiser Chiefs is quintessentially British guitar pop. And loveably so. Keys - in whatever form - are prominent from the off, introduced via the almost single fingered tinkering of the intro, and at around 3 minutes in there's an "A Day In The Life" like moment, where all parties, including, paradoxically, quietly-screamed vocals, get to build up the sound before heading into a chorus repeat and then fade. And rather good it is too. The whole song is, in fact.<br><bR>It's so laidback, but packed with ideas. On occasions it can evoke dreamy nothingness, a somewhat lackadaisical response, yet the next play may force the listener to get up and dance, all told a certain sprightly, more lively and upbeat reaction. Like drinking on a hot, dreamily slow summer afternoon. So go figure that one. Possibly it's because of the slower delivery of the verses, which conversely have a bouncy upbeat style to the vocal pattern. Equally possible is that it is because of the jerky nature of a rather glorious, but simple and memorable chorus.<br><br>This insanely catchy chorus is one of those that can cause serious family friction, though. After no end of non-stop plays, it should be noted that a certain brother of mine switched the auto-repeat off the CD player, and said in no uncertain terms that if he "ever heard <i>Oh my god, I can't believe it, I've never been this far away from home</i> again he would shove the CD... ". You get the gist. But I wouldn't bet against him singing it today too. Maybe that's his point; so catchy it borders on annoyingly unforgettable.<br><br>He loved it really...</p>
