    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Disasters" recorded by Disasters. The review was written by Sam Woodgate in 2011.</p>
    <p>The running time of this EP (5 tracks in 9 minutes) should give you a fairly good idea about what Disasters' most recent effort sounds like. Anyone looking for progressive 7 minute epics should jog on, because Disasters are a hardcore band in pretty much every sense of the word. Simply put, this EP is somewhat akin to the aural embodiment of aggression; in this sense, you could draw comparisons between them and a band such as Lavotchkin, but they're more reminiscent of The Ghost Of A Thousand with their relentless hardcore assault and heartfelt delivery.<br /><br />Kicking things off with 'The Safety Word' is a good move, as it means that the audience's first impression of Disasters is likely to be a good one; as short and angry as a pissed-off dwarf, their opening statement is powerful and straight to the point, setting the tone for the rest of the record nicely. What follows is 7 minutes of white-hot rage, played at breakneck speed; it's blistering stuff, and if you're a fan of real grassroots hardcore then this should be right up your street.<br /><br />The band don't deviate much from the formula, but that's hardly a negative thing; after all, when you can write songs as invigorating as 'Phoenix Ablaze' or 'The Accident', why would you seek to change it? Having said that, the choral vocals on 'The Accident' are a nice touch on what is already a quality track- it's good to see that the band are pushing themselves and not settling for the bare minimum, as so many hardcore bands seem to do these days.<br /><br />With these flourishes in mind, it's a bit of a shame that there aren't a couple more tracks for the band to really spread their wings on, but there is more than enough material here for fans to get their teeth stuck into- and in the form of 'Meat', they have a song so short that Napalm Death would be proud to call it their own. This EP is a stellar hardcore release that pulls no punches, and it's great to find such exciting prospects right on your doorstep; local heavy music hasn't looked this appealing in years.</p>
