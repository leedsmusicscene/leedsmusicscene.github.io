    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for The Keatings.</p>
    <p>We are The Keatings, two brothers from Bradford West Yorkshire. I'm Jake, 17, I sing and take rhythm guitar. Nick, 15, is my younger brother who takes lead guitar and backing vocals. We've been playing guitar with each other for 3-4 years now. Jamming more than anything. It's only recently that we've started looking for gigs and developing our stagecraft as a performing act.<br /><br />We didn't really come up with the band name, we entered a small battle of the bands at school a while back and our friend Mikey advertised us as "The Keatings" and the name has just stuck with us nicely since. It did beat his previous suggestion of "Ronan Eat Your Heart Out," and no, unfortunately there is no relation to Ronan Keating before you ask.<br /><br />Gigging is a relatively new experience for us. As mentioned previously there has been the odd battle of the bands at school which we've thoroughly enjoyed. We've been fortunate enough to be invited to play at a number local village events in Heaton which have also been a big help. <br /><br />Our greatest experiences have been in Snowdonia North Wales playing in a small pub with a house band. The Pub is called The Golden Fleece Inn, Tremadog. Russ and Andy, the house band, and everyone else there have been so supportive of us allowing us to join in on their regular Tuesday Night Jam Session and we've been unbelievably lucky to play with some world class musicians who often visit the area on holiday. It was Russ who cut our first track Fantasy Beach as a demo on his "Magic Box" it really did work a treat and you can hear the track on our soundcloud..</p>
