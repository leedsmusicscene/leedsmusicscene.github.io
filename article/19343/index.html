    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2015.</p>
    <p>I am pleased to announce the incredible, They Might Be Giants, return to The Brudenell Social Club on the 27th January 2016, kicking off a string of UK dates.   <br /><br />TMBG who were responsible for the smash hit "Birdhouse in Your Soul", have released 17 studio albums and featured in many films and hit TV shows.  They created the world's first downloadable album to audio and video podcasts to smart phone apps, They Might Be Giants' career has always been one of unlikely innovation. And now their most notorious innovation, Dial-A-Song, has been revitalized for 2015. The concept was originally launched in 1983 from John Flansburgh's Brooklyn kitchen via a consumer answering machine, Dial-A-Song let listeners in on the latest and greatest from the band years before their career took off on an international level.<br /><br />With a new song posted every week, the 2015 return of Dial-A-Song in online form would be an extraordinary challenge by any standards. Not only have this year's songs maintained an exceptionally high level of quality, every week has brought a new accompanying video. Following the release of Glean earlier this year the band are expected to announce details of the follow-up full-length album very soon<br /><br />They Might Be Giants - Erase (official video):<br /><br /><iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/apHV1CaQWOE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
