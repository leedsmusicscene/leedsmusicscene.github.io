    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for The Barmines.</p>
    <p>Members: Rob // Leam // Liam // James<br /><br />Drenched with Indie and Laced with Rock, The Barmines are not just another Leeds band....The release of their Debut EP "There's Never Any Romance" was played in front of a sold out Cockpit Room 2, just shy of 300 of their "Barmi Army" fans packed the place and shook it to its core. Since then they have played the likes of the O2 Academy in Sheffield, The Cockpit and The Wardrobe plus slots at Strawberry Fields Festival and Bingley Festival playing alongside some top bands like Catfish and the bottlemen and Reverand and the makers. Regular plays on BBC Introducing and plenty of interest from promoters across the country, the guys are heading in the right direction. 2015 will be a BIG year for the boys as they plan their first tour for the beginning of the year plus a new video and the hotly anticipated release of their new single. This is only the start of a long journey for The Barmines but one that will take them to where they want to be.<br /><br />"Causing a bit of a buzz" - Alan Raw BBC Introducing<br /><br />"Plenty of energy here" - Yorkshire Evening Post<br /><br />"If you are going to do indie rock, you should know your craft and the barmines do" - Vibrations Magazine Leeds<br /><br />"The Barmines are steadily and rightly so building up a reputation as one of the hottest bands to come from a current hotbed of Indie music in Leeds" - Emerging North<br /><br />"I'd also add that it is one of the best EP's i've heard all year" - Jason's Jukebox<br /><br />"Begging the question why have't this four-piece from leeds joined the likes of kasabian or arctic monkeys in the hallowed halls of indie royalty" -David Beech.</p>
