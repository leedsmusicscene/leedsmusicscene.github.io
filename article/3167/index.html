        <h1>The Prime Movers - Party Favours</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Party Favours" recorded by The Prime Movers. The review was written by Danny Martin in 2004.</p>
    <p>This EP seems from what I can gather to be arty indie funksters The Prime Movers' debut, and from that angle I suppose it ain't half bad.<br><br>Three tracks all with a similar structure; grubby endless bassline, skatty guitar rifts and heaps and heaps of good old fashion funk. "Private war" is the best by a distance, far more disorganised and entertaining, the bassline really drilling through the centre of the vocals. This would be the soundtrack to you sitting chilling in Fab or Bar Norman on a cold Saturday afternoon, but is "background musac band" what these guys are after? I doubt it.<br><br>The let down, one which is a reality and I am sure they are aware of is the quality of this recording. Mostly the lyrics are indistinguishable and the dirty bassline which backbones most of the songs just seems a bit lame in places. Coupled with a very weak kit and the horrendous sounding vocals this is not pleasurable listening.  I would desperately like to see this guys live to distinguish my view from perhaps what will be a different reality.<br><br>In the meantime though check them out if indie funk is your bag. For a debut it just about cuts it, but I believe the heart has overruled the head and urgency to get some material out has overruled patience to do it with style.</p>
