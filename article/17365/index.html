        <h1>Leeds Festival line up to be announced on 11th March</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2013.</p>
    <p>Festival Republic have this weekend confirmed that the third headliner for Leeds 2013 will be announced on Monday 11th March.<br /><br />On the same day the organisers will reveal many more other bands playing at the festival. Although we know about two of the three Main Stage headliners there has only been a small handful of bands from the Leeds 2013 lineup announced so far.<br /><br />Main Stage headliners confirmed so far are Eminem and Biffy Clyro, and they will be joined by local four piece and 2012 Mercury Award winners Alt J who will headline the NME / Radio One Stage. <br /><br />Leeds weekend tickets are still on pre-sale held at 2012 prices - Â£197.50 for a weekend ticket - these will go off sale on March 10th. <br /><br />There will then be a general ticket release at the time of the announcement, which probably means a price increase - more on weekend ticket prices when we know them. If you have been waiting for day tickets then these will go on sale at the same time.<br /><br />The line-up announcement will take place live on air on BBC Radio One at 715pm. Make sure you return to our site as we confirm the line up as soon as it is revealed.<br /><br />Leeds Festival takes place at Bramham Park between 23rd-25th August 2013.</p>
