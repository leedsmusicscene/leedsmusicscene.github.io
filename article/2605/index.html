    <p>Following on from their successful Roadworks 04 UK tour earlier this year, Leeds’ own Bodixa have been chosen from over 2500 aspiring bands to play the acoustic stage at this year’s Glastonbury festival.  And on the basis of the outstanding quality of their music and live performance.<br><br>Bodixa beat off stiff competition at a nail-biting audition at Glastonbury on Friday against five other finalists to earn their place at the world’s greatest music festival.  The judges - including Michael Eavis himself - gave Bodixa the thumbs-up after what he described as "...a close run competition of outstanding music".  Bodixa will play a set on the acoustic stage on Saturday 26th June at around 4:30 (ish). They will also feature in the BBC2 Glastonbury festival broadcast.<br><Br>After a successful UK tour under their belts, festival sets already confirmed at Tyneside on 12th June, and Greenbelt at the end of July, and now Glastonbury on 26th June - 2004 is turning out to be Bodixa’s year.</p>
