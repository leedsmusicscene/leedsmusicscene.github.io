        <h1>Falconetti - Oceanography</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Oceanography" recorded by Falconetti. The review was written by Richard Garnett in 2004.</p>
    <p>Surprisingly the holes left in the music world by the decline of Portishead and (less so) My Bloody Valentine have never been filled. Perhaps each operated in too distinctive a niche to be filled and yet Falconetti bare similar hallmarks to each - haunting guitars, washes of guitar distortion, slow whirling Gregorian female vocals and long songs. 3 tracks spread over 19 minutes is either ambitious or naive, but given the composition on offer we'll stick with the former for now and allow them the benefit of the doubt. This is mood music done on a low simmer, brooding over an industrial skyline at times while at others standing on a cliff, chilled by the ocean spray.<br><Br>Only opener "Oceanography" is graced by any lyrical content but it's more woooooooo's, eeeaaar's and mnooooo's than discernable words. All 3 tracks offer moments of simple and effective guitar trickery picking away at distressed chords heavily coated in reverb while accompanied by slumbering big drums and a bass only whales can hear. Holding all of this together is a surprisingly not out of place trumpet and even as closer "Body of Water" ascends to a power growl of an end the component parts continue to work together.<bR><br>This will not be everyone's cup of cha and live it could either prove interesting or disastrous without the aid of narcotics and a light show. It would be hard to package this work into 3-minute pop songs, but over the course of an inevitable 6-hour album Falconetti may have to consider some different recipes. For now this is an exciting and brave start avoiding all things current and "angular", cutting a path where only a few before have dared to tread.</p>
