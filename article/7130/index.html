    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for Andreya Triana.</p>
    <p>Andreya begun singing and songwriting from the age of seven taking influence from her mixed surroundings and cultural background. Hailing originally from South East London she moved to Worcester in the West Midlands at 14. At 17 she started doing an open mic night at the local music venue where the owner introduced her to a collective of musicians. It was with this collective of talented and musicians, called Bootis that was to form the bench mark for her 'musical education'. <br /><br />While studying for a degree in Music Technology in Leeds Andreya decided to reform Bootis with new members and a new sound influenced largely by Jazz, Funk and Nu Soul. It was with this new line up Andreya begun to refine her skills as a singer, songwriter and performer working with a vast arrey of musicians and producers in the process. Bootis gigged and recorded extensively over the course of two years doing their final gig at Live8 in 2005 in Edinburgh infront of an audience of 20,000.<br /><br />On finishing her degree Andreya fronted 8 piece Latin-Jazz outfit RSL touring the UK and begun embarking on her solo career. A host of collaborations followed and also her interest in developing her solo experiemental vocal set ensued in which she called FreeFlo Sessions. It was with these FreeFlo session home recordings and a heartfelt application that landed her a sought after place at the 2006 Red Bull Music Academy. Being one of sixty people to be selected worldwide she was flown to Australia for an intense and mind expanding experience, collaborating with some of the best musicians and producers in the world.<br /><br />Since coming back from the Red Bull Music Academy Andreya has found herself          travelling all over the world for gigs and musical projects including working with the legendary Mizell Brothers. 2007 saw her first collaborative projects released to rave reviews and radio play on BBC Radio One. Andreya currently resides in Brighton and  with a vast amount of experience under her belt she is now embarking on writing her first solo album..</p>
