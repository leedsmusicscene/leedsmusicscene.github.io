    <p>Tay Cousins, 19, is a fresh acoustic singer/songwriter with an edge. Originally from Wales, Tay moved to the city of Leeds at 18 to pursue her music career. Self-taught on guitar since the age of 14, song-writing also came naturally, developing styles consisting of Indie/Pop/R&B. Tay quickly found a route to captivating an audience through busking on the streets of Cardiff. "No one knew who I was, I would stand there in a baggy jumper with bright pink hair, but people would stop and listen, the fact they would put money in my case made me feel like I was doing something right."<br /> <br />She appeared at Mardi Gras Festival in Cardiff at 17, and started to gain a respected musical reputation in South Wales through persistent gigging and busking. Not long after she made it to the finals of UK Talent Competition 'Distributions Got Talent' where she raised £500 alone for Alzheimer's Society and was judged by the likes of Shane Lynch from Boyzone and David Van Day from Bucks Fizz. In 2012, she achieved an Extended Diploma in Music Performance and following that winning 'Welsh Factor 2012'. "One thing I am passionate about is being original. Although I'm young I've experienced a lot, so song-writing is endless for me."<br /> <br />Over the years the singer has performed at a variety of venues such as weddings, pubs and parties. Her most recent work includes performing at the classy 'Tiffanys Caffe Bar' in Harroagte every fortnight, and undertaking project work at Holy Trinity Church in Leeds where she is organising and performing at events. The quirky singer always has an original take on covers and loves getting involved with audience each time she performs.<br /><br />She was put forward by her management team for the Warehouse Leeds Talent Spot which she won, as par of her winning shot got to open their new store in the Trinity Leeds.<br /><br />On 11th April 2013 will be releasing her 1st official single 'Smoke in my Lungs'.</p>
