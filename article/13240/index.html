    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2010.</p>
    <p>It may be due to play host to some of the best music in the world, but the new Leeds Arena is to get a soundtrack of its very own - thanks to local band Escort Knights.<br /><br />The Leeds band have this week been named as winners of a competition to produce a special soundtrack for the new Leeds Arena, the new music venue that is due to be completed in 2012.<br /><br />Earlier this year, the Leeds Arena Project held a competition for local unsigned artists to have their music as the soundtrack for an animation showing the Leeds Arena in action. The animation will also showcase the 'super-theatre' design of the Leeds Arena and will be used in key marketing materials.<br /><br />The competition generated huge interest from local artists and the standard of submissions was extremely high. Ultimately, judges were wowed by Escort Knights' energetic track, 'I Don't Know Your Name', and this was selected as the winner.<br /><br />Councillor Richard Lewis, Leeds City Council's executive board member for city development, said: "We are delighted to announce Escort Knights as the winners of the Leeds Arena competition. The arena will take the profile of the music scene in Leeds to a whole new level and are delighted that a local band can be involved at this early stage. Their soundtrack will add something really special to the animation and we are sure they will have a really bright future."<br /><br />Jonathan of Escort Knights said: "We are both delighted and proud to be the first band to be associated with the new Leeds arena and a huge project that could give a massive boost to the local music industry."</p>
