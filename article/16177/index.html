    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2012.</p>
    <p>Beacons Festival 2012 was launched this morning with organisers revealing the initial line up, plans for a new site and availability of discounted 'early bird' tickets.<br /><br />Beacons is a three-day four-night festival taking place in the beautiful surroundings of the Yorkshire Dales (Funkirk Estate, Skipton to be precise) between 17th and 19th August 2012.<br /><br />The festival is brought to you by a collective of tastemakers who, for years, have been bringing the best music to reputable Northern venues such as Leeds' Nation of Shopkeepers and Brudenell Social Club, Sheffield's Bungalows and Bears, Club Pony and the Shipping Forecast. <br /><br />In 2012, the main stage acts are presented in association with The Stool Pigeon magazine and the first wave of bands announced for Beacons 2012 is:<br /><br />+ ROOTS MANUVA<br />+ JUNIOR BOYS <br />+ GHOSTPOET <br />+ ERRORS <br />+ FACTORY FLOOR <br />+  PEARSON SOUND <br />+ CASS MCCOMBS <br />+ WILLY MASON <br />+ D/R/U/G/S <br />+ PEAKING LIGHTS <br />+ XXXY <br />+ STAR SLINGER <br />+ SUBMOTION ORCHESTRA <br />+ BOK BOK <br />+ 2:54 <br />+ JAM CITY <br />+ KING KRULE <br />+ MAZES <br />+ STILL CORNERS <br />+ STAY+ <br />+ GROSS MAGIC <br />+ BOS ANGELES <br />+ GRASS HOUSE<br /><br />Many more bands - including the headliners - will be announced in March. <br /><br />Organisers will also be revealing their exclusive cinema programme as well as children's entertainment from the Ladybird Project, spoken word, theatre and dance.<br /><br />Regarding the location, organisers confirmed today that the site will be moved to reduce the risk of flooding, the reason for the cancellation of Beacons Festival 2011. Beacons Festival said in a statement: <br /><br />"Last year, due to extreme flooding, Health and Safety Executives made the decision to cancel Beacons Festival. We were devastated to have to cancel your party but were left with no choice. This year, we have moved the site away from any potential flood areas, still in the fantastic setting of Carleton.  The new location is even more picturesque than the previous site and we feel it can only enhance people's experience of what will be a truly amazing festival."<br /><br />Weekend tickets for Beacons Festival 2012 cost £84.50, which includes camping. <br /><br />However - for a limited time only - a small number of 'early bird' tickets are being made available at just £60 (£55 for students).  These tickets can be bought now from See Tickets,  Jumbo Records and Crash Records.<br /><br />The organisers are also offering a deposit scheme where you can put down £30 now and pay the balance before the 1st May. To take advantage of the deposit scheme visit the official Beacons Festival website.</p>
