    <p>The Cat is finally coming out of the bag! After being in existence for nearly 8 years Cloth Cat is now making its paw mark with ‘The Cat in Hells Dance’ event, which to all intents and purposes will be the project’s launch. The night coincides with the end of the autumn term, which has seen another 150 local people pass through Cloth Cat’s doors to gain skills in a range of music-related areas on free courses devoted to music journalism, performance, music creation using music software, live sound engineering and the business side of music, run in association with the Workers Educational Association.<br><bR>As well as performances from Buen Chico, the highly respected surf pop act currently flying high on the Leeds music scene, and Roguish Stranger, a quirky psychedelic 60s pop act whose members met through their involvement on Cloth Cat courses, there will be a series of showcases and individual performances from Cloth Cat students past and present.<br><bR>This will also be a chance for people to find out what happens on Cloth Cat’s courses and how they can sign up for the next term, which starts in January.<br><bR>Project Co-ordinator Mike Jolly says: “This feels like a real coming of age, a chance for everyone to come together and have a party. The event works so well on different levels, and it will also give us the chance to put the project on a pedestal at last and promote it to a wider audience.”<br><bR>The Cat in Hell’s Dance is held at the Woodhouse Liberal Club on Saturday 16th December, starting at 6.30pm and running all the way through to 12.30am.<br><bR>Entry is free!</p>
