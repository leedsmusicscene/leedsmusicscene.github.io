    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2006.</p>
    <p>After much speculation, The FA has today confirmed that chart-toppers Embrace will record the official England World Cup song to be released prior to the World Cup. Embrace were approached by The FA earlier this year and jumped at the chance to be part of the traditional World Cup preparations by writing a track for the team.<br><br>The song is titled "World At Your Feet" but the demos are being kept under wraps for the time being and will be revealed nearer to the start of the tournament. Lead singer Danny McNamara said:<br><br>"The band can't wait to get into the studio and record the new track. We think we've got a really good song and hopefully it will repeat the success of previous songs like New Order's World in Motion."<br><br>Embrace are currently at number two in the UK chart with their new single Nature's Law and their fifth album This New Day - released yesterday - is expected to top the album charts later this week.</p>
