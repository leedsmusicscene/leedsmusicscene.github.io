    <p>With less than a two weeks to go until the biggest weekend of music this summer, the countdown is on for Reading & Leeds 2015.<br /><br />Forever championing up and coming talent, the BBC Introducing Stage is back once again this year offering one of the biggest launch platforms for new music from the UK, having last year offered up sets from the likes of Jack Garratt, Rae Morris, and Prides. Over the years BBC Introducing stage has also hosted R&L debut slots from Jake Bugg, Catfish and the Bottlemen and Spector, the stage is a must visit for anyone wishing to catch future stars' formative moments.<br /><br />Headlining Friday at Leeds will be the massively up and coming, high energy band Childcare. Their playful debut EP Flush has garnered a huge amount of attention and with good reason; they are not to be missed. <br /><br />Saturday will see hotly tipped genre-masher Georgia headline, whose debut, self-titled album is sure to be one of the alternative hits of the summer. <br /><br />Sundays headliner is hotly-tipped, freshly signed Liverpool band Clean Cut Kid whose whip-smart pop is surely destined for the festival's bigger stages! Also appearing on the stage that day are Leeds genre-spanners Clay.  <br /><br />The stage also plays host to Centre Stage Competition winners The Mallrats as well as Futuresound Competition runners up Treason Kings, Samuel S. Parkes, Happy Daggers, Where Fires Are and NARCS.<br /><br />With something for everyone and the cream of the UK's upcoming talent on display, the BBC Introducing Stage is the place to be for any discerning new music fan.<br /><br />You can see some of the bands appearing and what Melvin Benn had to say at the regional press event here:<br /><br /><iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T1rx1NEzlew" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
