        <h1>The Old Time String Band</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for The Old Time String Band.</p>
    <p>Martyn and Daisy met in early 2007 in Leeds when 'The Lovesick Cowboys', for whom Martyn played double bass, played at Daisy and Frank's 'Mystical Variety Show' hosted at the Chemic Tavern. As the band needed a fiddle player, Daisy was asked to join the band and the rest, as the saying goes, was history. As Martyn and Daisy became an couple, they found themselves playing a mixture of folk, country and blues together on guitar, banjo and fiddle. These practices turned into busking sessions in York and then into gigs. Since April 2007 they have busked and gigged all around the UK, the Isle of Man & Spain. As a born and bred Yorkshireman, Martyn is keenly interested in folk music from this county which their set list reflects. Originally a bass guitarist and songwriter for rock and punk bands, he now plays a plethora of instruments and can turn his thumbpick to pretty much anything. Daisy comes from a folk music family and was classically trained, brought up in a mixture of folk festival sessions, quartets and orchestras. Her family, Jeannie and Sue Harris, and John and Benji Kirkpatrick are her central influences for the traditional English folk music that she plays with Martyn. Martyn and Daisy are currently learning new songs, booking gigs and preparing for a recording session. They welcome any offers to play near or far from their native Leeds, West Yorkshire..</p>
