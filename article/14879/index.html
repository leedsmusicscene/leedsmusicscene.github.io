        <h1>Little Vegas Lies - A Truth Not Far Away</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "A Truth Not Far Away" recorded by Little Vegas Lies. The review was written by Tim Hoadley in 2011.</p>
    <p>A ship is safe in the harbour, but that's not what ships are for - William Shedd.<br /><br />Bands have a gift. Through their art they have an uncensored, golden opportunity to get a message out into the world. As long as you have a message, whatever it is, people will listen. The Manic Street Preachers, although derided as mouthy, left-wing political upstarts, had a message and people listened. The Clash commentated furiously on various topics such as the monarchy and the racism blighting much of England during the 70's and 80's. Again people listened.  <br /><br />Now I'm not saying all bands have to be politically motivated, or find things wrong in their lives to write great songs. But debut EP from Dewsbury Indie band "Little Vegas Lies" lacks any kind of dynamism that is required for a band to be interesting, remembered and fundamentally, listened to. <br /><br />This EP is in no way a bad set of songs, they're nice. But I think that's my problem with  "A Truth Not Far Away," an obviously talented group of young lads wasted, by producing nice, safe, middle-of-the-road Indie-Rock.<br /><br />First track "Slip Away" starts promisingly, a mid-tempo head-nodder, reminiscent of 90's almost-rans Northern Uproar, the Gallagher-esq vocals betraying the bands obvious influences.  <br /><br />After doing what it says on the tin, the EP slips into "Calling" a song bursting at the seams with paradox couplets, 'Fast lane is feeling slower, High tide is seeming low' . Despite the lyrics, this is the strongest song in the set and one that demonstrates the band's tightness. "Calling" follows a tried and tested verse-chorus- verse formula, which creates a basically good song, but with that comes a sense of staid predictability.  <br /><br />Nominated Single "Ghost Town" is the lighter-in-the-air, sway side to side number. This is no 1981 political/social commentary from Jerry Dammers et-al, this is about a girl breaking up with a guy. You can see the point I'm trying to make...<br /><br />"All I need" wraps up the EP and finally produces lyrics that match the technical elements of the music. This bucks the trend of the other songs on the EP by starting poorly and getting better as the song progresses. There is a maturity in the lyrics and melody that takes this song to another level than that of its predecessors. This needs to be the future of "Little Vegas Lies" and I am sure as the band develops and grows together, this will be the case.  A safe debut, but take a few more risks on your next voyage.</p>
