    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2008.</p>
    <p>‘You Don’t Know How To Love’ is the debut single from Leeds-based two piece The Old Romantic Killer Band, a ferocious new act who are equal parts Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, Son House and Ryan Adams. Released on the Bad Sneakers Records label, the single is out on 7”, CD and Digital Download formats on 10th March.<br><br>Vocalist and guitarist Harry Johns (23) met drummer Bunse (19) whilst Harry was playing Bass in Leeds Hardcore DIY trio Joseph. They instantly bonded at a party over their mutual interest in tattoos, Black Flag and short aggressive live shows.<br><br>Their third live show was an official showcase gig at In the City in Manchester and from there they picked up early plays from XFM’s Jon Kennedy and a slot at the prestigious Nasty Fest in Leeds, where they headlined the second stage.  They are two angry young men who are joined by their common love of recklessness, post gig depravity and constant touring. Future shows include a short stint with Von Bondies and the South By South West Festival in Texas.<br><br>Catch The Old Romantic Killer Band live at Brudenell Social Club (11th February).<br><br>Watch the video here.</p>
