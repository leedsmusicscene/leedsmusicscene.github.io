        <h1>COMPETITION: Win a copy of the Xi DVD "Montauk"</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2005.</p>
    <p>LMS is hosting a competition to win a free “special edition” copy of Xi’s recently released DVD “Montauk”.<bR><bR>The DVD features two previously unreleased tracks and three videos, all produced and directed by Kevin Petch. The 100 numbered limited edition copies also have an exclusive web link to a “secret” web site only accessible via an on-disc link. This site will be updated with news, information and downloadable material that will be unavailable elsewhere.<br><br>All you have to do to enter the competition is click on the link below to view a short montage of clips taken from one of the videos on the DVD. In it, you will see shots of the mysterious “Man in Black”. If you think you know who he is, e-mail your guess to xi-competition@leedsmusicscene.net using the subject line “The Man in Black is...”<br><br>The competion closes at Midnight on Christmas Eve. If there is more than one correct identification, the winner will be randomly selected from all those who submit the correct name. If no-one guesses the correct name, the winner will be the entrant who, in the opinion of the judges, has made the most amusing guess.<br><br>The winner will be notified by e-mail on Wednesday 28th December.<br><br>Click here to download the clip (726k, not full DVD quality!).<br><br>The DVD Single “Montauk” is available online from www.xi-uk.com/eshop.htm<br><br>* Members of Xi, their management, those directly involved in the making of the DVD “Montauk” and the immediate families of all the above are not eligible to enter this competition. If, in the view of the competition judges, an entrant may have had prior knowledge of the identity of the mystery figure, their entry will be disqualified. Multiple guesses will not be accepted, one entry only will be accepted from each e-mail address. The decision of the judges is final and no correspondence will be entered into.</p>
