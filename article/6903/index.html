    <p>Local band The Hair have this week been announced as appearing at the Wireless Festival in Leeds on Sunday 25th June, playing on the same bill as bands such as The Who, Eels and The Zutons. At an event organised by Radio Aire, Galaxy FM and Channel 4, the four-piece were chosen to appear at the festival by a panel of music judges at the Faversham on Monday.<br><br>The Hair vocalist Sam Robson said, “It’s a great chance to play with some of the best bands around. It’s a brilliant line up and to be chosen from loads of other bands to be part of that is amazing.<br><br>The Who in particular are such a massive band and I never thought I would be on the same bill as them.”</p>
