    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for Patchwork Grace.</p>
    <p>Exploding out of Nottingham and Leeds Patchwork Grace live and breathe their art and wear their souls for all to see.  They are married to struggle and determination.  You'll hear the band drawing inspiration from the likes of The Doors and David Bowie, The Manic Street Preachers and Queens of the Stone Age alongside more modern and perhaps less obvious icons like Muse and Lady GaGa.  Their music and lifestyle is also influenced by the stylistic imagery of Tim Burton and the pop-rock car crash of a Tarantino movie. As a live act the band perform with passion, playing with equal amounts of emotion and aggression. They have a dedicated UK wide fan base and already fans overseas.<br /><br /> The identification with the emotion in their musical style makes them hard to pigeonhole into a specific musical genre.  They are glamorous and narcissistic; there is enough of an Indie vibe for the indie kids and more than enough rock for the rockers.  The band is cross-genre in the same way that The Foo Fighters staked their claim to all tribes.  Quite simply a brilliantly entertaining and genre defying act.<br /><br />In September 2010 Kerrang! Radio Listeners voted Patchwork Grace the UK's hottest unsigned female fronted band off the back of their independently released 'Play Dead' EP. After selling around 400 copies of the EP and receiving thousands of votes from Kerrang! Radio listeners the band decided to get to work on their second album.<br /><br />Patchwork Grace have completed work on their album 'Vincent' with producer John Mitchell (YouMe@Six, Alterbridge, Kids in Glass Houses, Architects).  Vincent was mastered by Jon Astley (Tori Amos, The Who, The Rolling Stones, PJ Harvey, David Bowie)<br /><br />The band have had their song 'Play Dead' used by TNA Wrestling to promote the IMPACT show and January 2011 arena Tour..</p>
