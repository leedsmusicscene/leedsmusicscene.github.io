        <h1>Harmacy - Carla's Song</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Carla's Song" recorded by Harmacy. The review was written by Chris Woolford in 2006.</p>
    <p>I was lucky enough to review Harmacy’s first offering. They must have liked what I wrote because they sent me another one!<br><br>Anyway, this time Harmacy sound even more like the Lemonheads than they did on the last. To me this is a good thing. I love The Lemonheads (I really should dig out my old copy of ‘Shame About Ray’).<br><br>‘Carla’s Song’ is a three minute slacker rock ditty about being careful around girls with names that begin with the letter ‘C’.<br><br>Now I don’t know if this is actually true, because I’ve never been out with a girl called Catherine or Claire or Carlotta, but I shall take heed from now on. Anyway, back on track (sorry!), it’s got witty lyrics, a catchy tune and it sounds well good. Nice one. Top work.<br><br>The second and final, for now, offering is ‘A Date With The Bar’. This time the band surpasses everything I’ve heard from them before. There’s a big hint of Nirvana (Heart Shaped Box: “Hey, wait, I’ve got a new complaint”) in the melody without it sounding even remotely grunge or punk or new wave. And after some really beautiful guitar parts and blissed out power chords it’s all over almost before it’s begun, which is a shame because it’s bloody great.<br><br>Remind me to get off my arse and see these guys soon. If they’re anywhere near as good live as they are on CD then they’ll be fantastic. They’ve got great songs, they’ve got a great sound and they really should be playing higher profile gigs.</p>
