    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for Neil McLarty.</p>
    <p>Neil McLarty is in thrall to a time when passionate country tinged rock ruled the airwaves. On his debut album 'Roseville Grand'  the sound of  sublime pedal steel guitars and creaky organs wash over loose laid back rhythms and lazy guitar breaks that recall the early seventies California heyday of Neil Young. But this is also a musician borne from the recent alt.folk/americana scene that has thrown up bands like Fleet Foxes, Felice Brothers and Wilco. <br /><br />Scottish singer songwriter Neil McLarty has been a relentless live performer over the past few years in and around the indie rock scene of Leeds and further afield on the UK's fledgling Americana scene. Either solo or with the band Roseville Grand his support slots with the likes of Rod Picott & Amanda Shires and Danny and The Champions of The World.<br /><br />Recognition of his status as one of the UK's foremost Americana performers came in 2010 when Neil was asked to contribute a track to a new collection of the best of UK Americana called "Divided By a Common Language" on Clubhouse Records. His track "The Highway" appeared alongside songs by Alan Tyler and Southern Tenant Folk Union. The collection got a great response from Uncut magazine and DJ legend Bob Harris <br /><br />In October 2010 he will release his debut album "Roseville Grand", recorded in Leeds under the watchful eye of producer Richard Formby (Wild Beasts, Spaceman 3, Herman Dune, Dakota Suite.) Using vintage equipment and recording to tape, the old-fashioned way, the record is an authentic slice of county rock sunshine..</p>
