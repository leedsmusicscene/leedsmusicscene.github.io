    <p>With the lineup for the Leeds Festival 2006 recently announced, tickets now sold out and with the summer just around the corner, it can only mean one thing for West Yorkshire bands ... yes, that's right, it's the annual Futuresound Competition!<br><br>Futuresound 2006 will once again see thirty hopeful Leeds bands - selected from hundreds of applicants - play at a series of showcase gigs at the Cockpit throughout July. Six bands will be selected via industry reps to go on to play at the Leeds Festival - and one band will be selected to play on the Carling Stage as part of a lineup that already includes such stars as Leeds bands Kaiser Chiefs and The Cribs as well as Franz Ferdinand and Pearl Jam.<br><br>The Futuresound competition is now in its sixth year and well-established on the Leeds music calendar. If you would like to enter or wish to find out further details of the competition, you can find information, conditions of entry and application forms at www.thecockpit.co.uk.<br><br>The deadline for entries will be the 12th May.</p>
