    <p>Club Smith have announced the release of their new EP - titled 'Appetite for More Chivalry' - on December 30th through the Pias UK / Tri-Tone label.<br /><br />When Club Smith's drummer left the band to join Kaiser Chiefs, the remaining members made a firm decision this would be the last action that connected them to "guitar bands". The immediate response was a re-work of highlights from their 2012 album "Appetite for Chivalry", the result of which is this 4 track EP.<br /><br />Club Smith returned to the studio for new mixes of "Beautiful & Useless" and "The Green Room" that reflected an eclectic range of influences developed through the recording of the debut album. <br /><br />Working with super-producers Dave Bascombe (Depeche Mode) and Lance Thomas (Ladytron) the new mixes see the group taking a more electronic direction ahead of a planned second album.<br /><br />Included with this EP are two "live re-works" of album tracks, recorded in iconic Yorkshire locations with 20-strong ensembles crowd sourced via social networks, with each musician creating their own part for the recording. Both of these live sessions were filmed as they were recorded and include live choirs, marimbas, saxophones, trombones and modest drum troupes amongst an army of contributors.<br /><br />These new recordings round off a year since the release of their debut album that has seen Club Smith relentlessly evolving and adapting the group's approach to song-writing and arrangements, providing the perfect springboard for the group's second album.<br /><br />You can watch the video to 'Beautiful & Useless' below.<br /><br /><iframe width="640" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/njJ4ldvbbAc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br /><br />Listen to the full EP on Soundcloud.<br /><br /><iframe width="100%" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/16480483&color=ff6600&auto_play=false&show_artwork=true"></iframe></p>
