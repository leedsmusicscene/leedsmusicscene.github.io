        <h1>The Lab - 2.4 Area</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "2.4 Area" recorded by The Lab. The review was written by Dave Sugden in 2002.</p>
    <p>It's taken a while to come to the conclusion that this one-track demo shows quite a lot of potential, as, at first, I wasn't that impressed.  It's a song that you grow to like, helped by me trying different CD players and equalisation. Running in at just over four minutes, "2.4 Area" reminds me a lot of another Leeds band, Capital State.<Br><br>Primarily a guitar-band, The Lab actually deliver a dance/rock cross over.  Yet whilst they have more emphasis on the dance than the rock, I'd like to clarify that this isn't your chart-dance; this is more cultural, living-on-an-estate styled dance/rock - it has an attitude and forces reality checks: "No need for your villians with hammers, You can leave your blades at home, This is a 2.4 Area, And this is where I'm from". Although there's a comparison with Capital State, it's the rockier variance within the choruses that makes this record differ - distortion, and (almost) a metal guitar noise hits you whilst the dance base remains.<Br><br>I'm suitably impressed for my first experience of The Lab.</p>
