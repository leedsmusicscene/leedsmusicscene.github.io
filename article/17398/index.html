    <p>The price of Leeds Festival tickets was confirmed today with another small increase seeing the cost of a weekend ticket nudge just over the £200 barrier for the first time.<br /><br />A weekend ticket, which includes full access to the campsites between Thursday and Monday, will now cost £202.50, up £5 from the price last summer. If you just want to attend Leeds 2013 on a single day the price will be £90 per day. <br /><br />All tickets are subject to a maximum booking fee of £8 and will go on sale on sale on Monday 11th March just after midnight at 12.15AM.<br />  <br />All ticket types can be bought via the major online ticket agencies such as Ticketmaster and See Tickets, as well as the independent records stores in Leeds where you can buy online or in-person: Jumbo Records and Crash Records.<br /><br />Want to save money?<br /><br />1. The Leeds Visitor Centre at Leeds City Station will again be selling tickets for Leeds Festival with no added booking fee - so long as you pay by cash. That's a saving of £8 per ticket. If you pay by credit card the fee is £3, which is a saving of £5 per ticket.<br /><br />2. The ticket pre-sale is still on-going and if you buy your tickets for Leeds 2013 sometime over this weekend you will save yourself £5 per ticket.  The pre-sale ends on Sunday night though so be quick.<br /><br />3. There are still places available on the CATs programme for volunteer workers at Leeds Festival. Festival stewards work three x 8 hour shifts and are able to spend the rest of the time watching the bands. <br /><br />4. Not really a money saver ... but it might help in the short term. The price is still the same, but in order to help fans manage their finances organisers are once again running a ticket payment plan with purchasers able to spread the cost of a weekend ticket over three separate instalments of £67.50. More details, including payment terms and conditions, can be found on the Instalment Plan for Leeds 2013 tickets page.<br /><br />Leeds Festival 2013 is officially launched on Monday evening at 7pm when we get to hear more bands from the line-up and who will be joining Biffy Clyro and Eminem as Main Stage headliners. We'll post further news as soon as it is revealed.</p>
