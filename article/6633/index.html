    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2006.</p>
    <p>After the immense success of the inaugural Quidrophenia bandfest at Oporto it returns for a second time on Monday 1st May, May Day, to rock the foundations of Call Lane.<br><br>Featuring 15 live bands and 5 live acoustic acts throughout the day, interspersed by the renowned JP on the decks, Quidrophenia celebrates the best up and coming talent from the city of Leeds, with all entry fee proceeds going to Cancer Research UK.<br><br>Organiser, Marko Crossley of Leeds band Jack Afro, has brought together an amazing line-up which includes The Bazaars, The Pigeon Detectives and The Rivers on the band stage and Michael Kerr and Baxter Trappe on the acoustic stage.<br><br>Quidrophenia, taking its name from the mod film Quadrophenia, costs just £1.00 to get in, hence the name. All of the proceeds go to Cancer Research UK. Last year's event raised a fantastic £550 and this year Oporto is hoping to raise much more with raffle prizes up for grabs to increase the total.<br><br>Oporto manager, Paul Lane, commented, “The first Quidrophenia was such a success we instantly decided to carry it on and host another one. Oporto are proud to be involved in and promoting such a landmark Leeds music event and hope to continue to do so as long as Quidrophenia keeps running.”<br><br>Marko Crossley added, “I am really proud of Quidrophenia and hopefully this time it will be even bigger and better than last time, if that’s possible! And with a bit of luck we’ll raise even more money for Cancer Research too. It's a great way of showcasing the amazing talent that is around in Leeds at the moment.”<br><br>In addition to the normal entry, 50 advance tickets are available from Oporto at £5 each - these tickets guarantee you entry and allow you to pass out in and out as many times during the day as you please without paying again. Ask bar staff for details.</p>
