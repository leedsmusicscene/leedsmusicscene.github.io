    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for Parisman.</p>
    <p>The evolution of Parisman begins when Mike Saville and Shaun Halloran, unable to play an instrument between them, decide to start a band.<br><br>Having met James Scholes at music college, the trio set about playing gigs in any venue that would have them. Realising that their limited sound was holding them back from creating the music that was in their heads, they enrolled Ian Cassidy, an old friend who filled the sound out nicely. The final piece of the jigsaw was completed when the band asked Hoochy, who the band knew from gigging with his previous band, to join. This is where the story begins...<br><br>The first winter Parisman spent together was used in creating and honing an original sound. Regular gigs at established music venues in the North, such as The Cockpit (Leeds) and Night and Day Caf√© (Manchester), gave the band the experience to enter and win FutureSound, the prize being a slot at the Leeds Carling Festival.<br><br>Gaining confidence and building up a substantial fan base, Parisman began performing further a field, taking in cities such as Sheffield, Manchester, Wolverhampton, London and notably York, where Parisman won the prestigious 'Fibbers/Carlsberg Battle of the Bands'. Continuous gigging has seen Parisman share the stage with bands such as Four Day Hombre, Nylon Pylon, Alfie, Utah Saints and the Libertines.<br><br>With three eclectic E.P.'s already recorded showcasing the bands wide range of musical influences Parisman continue going from strength to strength..</p>
