A lucky few were also given a sneak preview of the song on Thursday at Moyle's local pub in North London. Embrace vocalist Danny McNamara treat pub locals to an exclusive play which was met with a rousing reception from all those present.<Br><br>Whilst Danny admits writing the song has been a massive challenge, he hopes it will live up to expectations. "We think we've got a really great song in World At Your Feet and with luck it'll capture the nations mood as well as New Order's World In Motion. It was a real honour to be asked and I hope we've delivered".<br><br>Embrace were announced as the FA's choice just three weeks ago, in a week that saw their latest album This New Day, the follow up to their double platinum selling album Out Of Nothing, hit number one in the UK album chart.<br><br>World At Your Feet will be available as 2 CDs and 7" single with details of additional tracks to be announced shortly.</p>
