    <p>Organisers of the Leeds Festival Fringe, the 7 days grass roots music event that takes place in Leeds city centre venues, have announced its return for a second year in 2011. <br /><br />From 18th to 24th August, Leeds will host over 140 bands and musicians as part of the Leeds Festival Fringe, with many venues and promoters supporting the event.  <br /><br />Well-known Leeds promoters Hempen Jig Promotions, Grain Division, Beat Surrender, All Sorted Records, Bad Brains and I Heart Indie are all on-board this year.<br /><br />Leeds Festival Fringe events will be hosted in a number of Leeds music venues, including Carpe Diem, The New Conservatory, Milo, Dry Dock, Empire, The Northern Monkey, The Grove, Baby Jupiter, The Well, Stone Roses Bar, Sandinista!, Smokestack and The Ship.<br /><br />The Acoustic Fringe will be running once again and organisers have announced that Futuresound 2011 winners The Coopers will be headlining the Friday night. <br /><br />If you have a ticket for the festival, you can watch The Coopers on the Festival Republic Stage.<br /><br />The Mexanines, winners of the Centre Stage competition at the O2 Academy Leeds, are appearing on several nights at Leeds Festival Fringe.<br /><br />Local band Miranda Versus The Crok are doing a "7 gigs in 7 nights" challenge, playing acoustically or electrically at several fringe venues.<br /><br />This year organisers have introduced two new events. Firstly, there will be the Metal Fringe, which will be running for 3 days between 19th-21st August at the new venue Empire.<br /><br />The second main event is on Saturday, 20th August, where the Leeds Festival Fringe will be taking over the city centre of Leeds. <br /><br />The main stage (Briggate, outside Debenhams) will feature music, dance, fashion, drama and comedy. The main musical act for this event is Middleman.<br /><br />The other event spaces will be used for a mass busking event in what will be a really exciting day with outdoor events and gigs in eight of the Leeds Fringe venues.<br /><br />The whole event will be broadcast live by East Leeds FM from their funky caravan and by Leeds Indie Radio who will be using The New Conservatory as their base.<br /><br />Many of the events are free, but an all-week ticket is available for Â£5 (Crash, Jumbo, HMV) that gets you into all the official event gigs.</p>
