        <h1>Danny North photography exhibition to launch at the Faversham on May 10th</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2008.</p>
    <p>When Leeds photographer Danny North came up with the idea of having an exhibition and releasing a book to coincide, he'd only been a full time pro for one year. During that time he established himself as a core member of the NME Editorial team, chief fashion photographer for Front Magazine, editorial photographer for Rock Sound, and perhaps most impressively, became the official touring photographer for one of the most successful British indie bands ever: Leeds five-piece Kaiser Chiefs.<br><br>Between 2005 and 2007, Danny was the photo editor of Sandman Leeds, the excellent music magazine from the north of England which is where Danny learned his trade, and some of these images play no small part in the exhibition, as Danny is as happy shooting up and coming acts from Leeds as he is international successes like My Chemical Romance or Foo Fighters.<br><br>The Exhibition will be displayed at The Faversham for one month, from 10th May (launch night) until  8th June. The Exhibition also has an accompanying book which is limited to just 100 signed / numbered copies, so get yours early!</p>
