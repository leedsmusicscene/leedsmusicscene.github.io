    <p>I Like Trains have announced plans for a ten date tour of the UK and a brand new EP entitled Beacons. The EP will feature the track Beacons, taken from their critically acclaimed third album The Shallows plus 3 brand new tracks, which I Like Trains are currently recording in their new studio.<br /> <br />The EP coincides with their first tour of 2012. The band will play across the UK and EU kicking off with an ambitious hometown show at The City Museum in Leeds on October 13th. The museum show will feature two ticket types.  In addition to standard entry, there will be tickets for entry to the Upper Circle seating.  The Upper Circle tickets will also include a screen printed poster to mark the event plus a guided tour of the museum.  Leeds tickets are available through the band's online shop. <br /> <br />"This is our first headline show in our home town of Leeds for a long time and we're really excited to be putting it on at the City Museum.  After launching our last album at The Deep aquarium in Hull, we realised how special it can be to perform live music in venues people wouldn't normally associate with live music.  It is something we vowed to do more of as and when the opportunities arose.  The extra planning and effort will all become worth it when we see our fans, friends and family filling this beautiful building in anticipation of our live show.  We're making plans to incorporate the five big projection screens they have in the main hall to create an ambitious multimedia performance.  It is these shows that you live for as a live band, and we genuinely can't wait to kick off our tour with such a unique gig" David Martin<br /><br />The Beacons EP is available to pre-order now and is out on CD and Digital on 15th October 2012 through ILR.
