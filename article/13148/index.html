    </div>
    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2010.</p>
    <p>With only two months before the Leeds Festival at Bramham Park, attention has turned once again to the annual Futuresound competition.<br /><br />The competition is the focal point of the summer for local bands and is now into its second decade of selecting bands for the festival. <br /><br />Throughout June and July the Cockpit venue in Leeds played host to 40 hopefuls, all wanting to win one of six places on the prestigious Leeds and Reading Festival line ups. <br /><br />Five of the six bands will play on the BBC Introducing Stage at both Leeds and Reading, and the one overall winner will receive a Â£500 cash prize and the opening slot on the Festival Republic stage at both Leeds and Reading. <br /><br />The Leeds Music Forum was once again chosen to announce the winners and there has been one winner revealed per hour since 5pm today. <br /><br />In advance of the Futuresound announcement today, Leeds band Sketches were separately chosen to play the BBC Introducing Stage. Therefore, although they entered Futuresound they have been taken out of the running.<br /><br />The five runners up for Futuresound 2010 are: Wot Gorilla?, Soul Circus, Runaround Kids, Blacklisters and Club Smith. <br /><br />The overall winner in 2010 is Kasiuss. Kasiuss will appear live on the Festival Republic Stage at both Leeds and Reading sites.<br /><br />Leeds Music Scene wishes all bands that played Futuresound the very best of luck, and we look forward to watching the winning six bands at Leeds Festival this August.<br /><br />If you haven't yet bought tickets for Leeds 2010 then try Viagogo, the official partners for the Leeds Festival.</p>
