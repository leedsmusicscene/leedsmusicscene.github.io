    </div>
    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2004.</p>
    <p>Festival organisers, Mean Fiddler, have announced that weekend tickets for this year’s Carling Weekend: Leeds Festival have totally sold out in record time.<br><br>The event, now in its sixth year and at its new home in the stunning grounds of Bramham Park, is firmly established as the music event of the summer for the North of England. Over three days, music fans from the North will be treated to headline performances from The Darkness, White Stripes and Green Day with excellent support from internationally renowned names such as Morrissey, The Offspring, current double Number One holders The Streets, The Libertines and Franz Ferdinand. Over three days and six stages, the festival will see more than 150 bands and a top line up of comedy and cabaret entertain over 60,000 people with the festival line-up of the summer.<br><bR>With all tickets for the Reading sister site now sold out, a very small number of Leeds day tickets are now the only available option for those wishing to join the party.<bR><bR>To buy a day ticket please visit Ticketmaster for Friday / Saturday / Sunday.<br><bR>Mean Fiddler MD, Melvin Benn said of the record double sell-out: “This is brilliant.  Last year was the best we had ever had and managed to sell out on the weekend of the festival.  To sell out of weekend tickets with more than a month to go really demonstrates that Leeds and its new home has arrived and that the bill is as awesome as I thought it was.”</p>
