    <p>Leeds five-piece Kaiser Chiefs are:<br /><br />Ricky Wilson (vocals)<br />Andrew "Whitey" White (guitar)<br />Simon Rix (bass)<br />Nick "Peanut" Baines (keyboards)<br />Nick Hodgson (drums and vocals)<br /><br />Having previously played together in various guises, it was in 2003 that Kaiser Chiefs were officially unleashed. In April 2004, the band released their debut single "Oh My God" on indie label DrownedinSound which reached number 66 in the UK charts, received "Single Of The Week" from NME and had Radio One's Steve Lamacq describe its "jerky, lurching chorus which had Your Humble Scribe hooked after three plays".<br /><br />Signed to B-Unique shortly afterwards, Kaiser Chiefs released the Top 20 hit "I Predict A Riot" in November 2004, before again hitting the charts with the re-release of "Oh My God" in February 2005.<br /><br />The multi-platinum selling debut album "Employment" reached number 2 in the UK album chart and was top ten in the US. Appearances at Glastonbury Festival and Live 8 followed.<br /><br />Second album, "Yours Truly, Angry Mob" was released in February 2007 and went to number 1 in the UK album chart in March..</p>
