    <p>Lead Guitar/Vocals - Dave Atha<br />Bass/Vocals -  Lee Moss<br />Drums - Tom McLaughlin<br /><br />	<br />AlmostNEW! are pop punk/post hardcore band formed in late 2009 because we all had an aim to create great music that was energetic and fun. Although we may not be to everyone's taste, we do try our best.<br /><br />Our original 2009 line up included Jack Brennan on bass but we hit 2010 we were joined by Nat McCartney on bass and we wrote and gigged constantly to get ourselves known in the local community. At the end of 2010 we we're lucky enough to support Dinosaur pile up in our very own home town.<br /><br />In April 2011 we recorded our debut self titled e.p with Tony Garthwaite. The e.p can be found on our band camp and sound cloud site with the option of a free download. <br /><br />This e.p enabled us to start gigging further a field and we gigged in such towns as Hudersfield and Harrogate.<br /><br />In September 2011 Nat decided he wanted to go off and educate himself at university . So we we're joined by Lee Albert on bass. At this moment in time we decided to change our sound and we are now working on a Post hardcore/Pop Punk album which we plan to release along with a whole other mix of things in February 2012 after a few warm up gigs in late January.<br /><br />We'll be at the party soon, don't worry about us! <br /><br />AN! :).</p>
