    <p>The annual Bed Race in Knaresborough is being invaded by a whole host of Leeds bands that are set to cause equal measures of awesomeness and ecstatic joy for one and all. But wait, they're not taking part in the Bed Race but playing at Henshaws at the infamous Bed Fest, now in its fourth year the festival is the only place to be in North Yorkshire on Saturday 11th June. Henshaws Arts and Crafts Centre has become both the pinnacle of the grass roots music scene in the Harrogate and Knaresborough area and an important fundraising event for the charity Henshaws.<br /><br />This year the festival has attracted the most bodacious acts such as the hippest hip hop funkadelic band Fold with their unique sound, Louise Distras who is known up and down the country as a punk hero, supporting the likes of Billy Bragg and the Buzzcocks, since 2013, the undeniable sound of one of Leeds' worst kept secret Treason Kings who are reknown for being one of the best live acts the city has to offer. <br /><br />The line-up is completed by over twenty five other acts of a variety of musical genres, including the Paul Mirfin Band, hip newcomers Black Ocean, Rob Reynolds and recent Amp Award winners Two Tone Rust.<br /><br />This fantastic free festival takes place at Henshaws Arts and Crafts Centre, 50 Bond End, Knaresborough on Saturday June 11th and is open from noon until midnight.  <br />Henshaws is a charity supporting people living with sight loss and a range of other disabilities. To go beyond expectations.<br /><br />For more information go to www.henshaws.org.uk, search Henshaws Live on facebook and follow @Henshaws_Live on Twitter.</p>
