    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for Mr Shiraz.</p>
    <p>Mr.Shiraz are one of the hardest working bands in the industry and in 2005 were crowned champions at the prestigious Mean Fiddler/Futuresound tournament and went on to play at the illustrious Carling Festival weekend to a packed, enthusiastic audience. The success of the show was evident when they were once again asked back to play the following year.<br /><br />Shortly after Mr.Shiraz were in heavy demand again with European tours including festivals across Belgium, Germany, Holland, Switzerland, Austria, Czech Republic and many more. After successful tours the band signed a recording contract with "Triumphant Sound" in the UK and "Firestorm Records" in the US which allowed their album "I'm Invincible, I'm Built Like A Sherman Tank, Somebody try and STOP ME" to be sold in major stores world-wide.<br /><br />Soon after the album was launched, the band received airplay across Europe (including Radio 1's "Lock-Up" & Xfm) and magazines such as Metal Hammer, Big Cheese & Kerrang! were soon giving Mr.Shiraz glowing reviews for their adrenaline fueled live shows. <br />The band now had an ever growing fan-base which was now demanding a US tour and Mr.Shiraz were promptly signed up with a premier California based booking agent M.I.A. Management, who arranged a demanding 4 week east and west coast tour, which also led the band to be offered a place at the SXSW Festival in Austin, Texas.<br /><br />But that was then and this is now....<br /><br />2011 sees a very different sounding Mr.Shiraz. The band have been through a transformation in the way of line-up, and in terms of sound. The band have ditched their ska/punk image and have come back to the studio to record a very different and personal album called "Chemistry". It's a very much more mature and driven sound that has had reviewers of their live shows comparing the new "Mr.Shiraz" to that of The Bronx, Faith No More & Rage Against the Machine. <br /><br />"Chemistry", is in the final stages and will be released nationwide in October 2011. The new album will also be followed by a major tour encompassing a full UK/European Tour in 2011 and a full east and west US tour in 2012.<br /><br />As seen with: <br /><br />Biffy Clyro, Alkaline Trio, Skindred, Therapy?, Voodoo Glow Skulls, Starpool, Kaiser Chiefs, Bouncing Souls, Reel Big Fish, Luchagors and many more....</p>
