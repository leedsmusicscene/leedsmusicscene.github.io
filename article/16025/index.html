        <h1>The Dauntless Elite - More Bloody Bad News</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "More Bloody Bad News" recorded by The Dauntless Elite. The review was written by Danielle Millea in 2012.</p>
    <p>Before I mention the music that these Leeds lads have released onto the general public for the second time, I must mention the presentation. With its cut and paste appearance and the brain on the CD that pops out of the card wallet this is a fine attempt at some Terry Gilliam and Monty Python stuff. Great work by Joe Watson of Attack Vipers.<br /><br />Inside and on the brain that I have just removed is a collection of some raw Northern England punk rock, performed the way that they do best. Singer Joe's Yorkshire accent is as thick as a Pontefract cake and hits you straight from the start of 'Saliva'. Song titles like 'Better Than Nowt' and 'Sod This for A Game Of Soldiers' should point this out to you too. 'Motion Sickness' brings the tempo up and down, like being on a real punk rock boat. There are fast tracks on this album, like the speedy 'I Don't Wanna Be A Transhuman', but then they can swing it the other way with the slower 'Silent Running'. 'Danson In The Dark (Don't Ask Me)' is a stand out track with its at war lyrics versus a real danceable melody. Whether or not it's owt to do with Ted I have no idea...<br /><br />Although this is only their second album this band are influences for many, many other Northern bands and the time it has taken them to release this self-described 'tricky' album shows that its quality, not quantity. A great release and a blumming pleasure to look at and listen to.</p>
