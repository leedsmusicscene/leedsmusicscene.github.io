    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2005.</p>
    <p>Young musicians in Leeds are being offered the chance to follow previous participants The Music, Bodixa and 10,000 Things by taking part in the annual Bright Young Things showcase organised by Leeds City Council. BYT 2006 is now accepting applications from musicians and bands under the age of 25, from which fifteen will be selected by music experts and given the opportunity to work in a recording studio and feature on a compilation CD to be released in March next year. Thousands of copies of the CD are distributed each year with many being sent to music industry and media contacts around the country.<br><br>Leeds City Council Executive Member for Leisure Councillor John Procter said: "Bright Young Things is a wonderful opportunity for young musicians in Leeds to take their first step into the music industry. It is a great starting point and gives young people the chance to get to meet similarly enthusiastic musicians and have their music heard by people throughout the city and beyond.‚Äù<br><br>Bands wishing to enter should submit a demo of original work, a biography, a couple of photos and a completed application form (obtained from www.leeds.gov.uk/byt) by Friday 18th November.</p>
