    <p>Formed in leeds in 2008, Sound of sirens have spent the last two years building up a reputation as a stellar live band. with catchy, pop infused songs with a heavier, edgy undercurrent, the band have been fortunate to perform all over the U.K, and have had significant radio airplay. having just completed their first UK tour, the band are now working on their debut album, scheduled for release in 2011. <br /><br />press<br /><br />"The tune is captivating from the start" <br />- Sapphire Wheeler, the Leeds Scenester <br /><br />"they held their own with a commanding presence, front-man Rob Doherty demanding hands in the air from the start. His stamina proved nothing short of remarkable as he leapt about the stage flexing and dancing like a Stooges era Iggy Pop. Together they forced their way through an energetic set of punchy indie rock tracks " - Reece Stables, LeedsMusic Scene<br /><br />"'One Step' boasts a hooky, pop-infused chorus that makes it a thoroughly enjoyable listen"<br />- Jessica Thornsby, Leeds Music Scene <br /><br />"this could be the next big band to come out of leeds. " - Orky, gig & Events Guide <br /><br />"make no mistake, this band could be big. very big. " - Skippy10, Eventful (Apr 08, 2009) <br /><br />"awesome!!! melodic with an energetic edge at the same time " - dan (cake meets face).</p>
