        <h1>Laura Audio - Untitled</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Untitled" recorded by Laura Audio. The review was written by Sam Saunders in 2003.</p>
    <p>Sounding like five tracks fresh from the rehearsal rooms this demo announces another exciting project from Kevin McGonnel of And None of Them Knew They Were Robots.<Br><br>The opening bars of "Parked and Centred" are as uncompromising and uncomfortable as the Robots ... with a naggingly harsh vocal track that might want to re-record itself at a later date. But even in this track a new direction asserts itself with enthusiastic confidence. We're in lyrical territory with rolling guitar phrases and nudgingly protective bass and drums.<Br><br>Track two "Hello" has a meltingly warm acoustic guitar intro with matter-of-fact harmonics that (for once in the world) sit easily in the delightful tune. The voice is gentled down and a second vocal line brings in a ghostly regret. Percussion is no more than tapping. Very good.<Br><br>"Elizabethan Mix" starts to bring the three-piece band sound together in a distinctive way.<Br><br>"Plus Plus Plus" has a power and dignity that overwhelms any doubts from earlier tracks. Minimal, but completely captivating. Subtly doubled up vocals and a delicious cello part from Jennifer Chubb over a gently walking bass add up to a perfectly realised 2 minute 24 second classic of understated passion. You must have this song.<Br><br>"Hey Sailor" carries the same mood and extends the reach. There is some melodically off-kilter tussling between guitar, bass and Alvin Lee Ryan's drumming that I find irresistible. When the cello comes in we have the final ingredient for a deeply satisfying piece of music. It sounds tentative and only just finished, and has a perfection because of it. More fussiness in the studio and longer spent on planning the changes and the layers might have killed it.<Br><br>So, excitement all round. .Laura Audio. are on the verge of something that is both intelligent and accessible - that pop transforming possibility that the indie world dreams will one day Vanquish All Pap. (but which we secretly hope will stay our own jealous pleasure)</p>
