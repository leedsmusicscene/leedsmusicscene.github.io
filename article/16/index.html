        <h1>Lorimer - Repeat Offender</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Repeat Offender" recorded by Lorimer. The review was written by Francois El-Alfy in 2001.</p>
    <p>So, they're good enough for John Peel, then.  Still, he's not that fussy, is he?  Let's face it, an hour of obscure euro punk and you start reaching for Radio 2 before seizures set in half the time - or is that just me?  Then, of course, comes the listening test, and I reckon the old gravely voiced siren of the alternative really struck a seam with Lorimer.<Br><bR>Repeat Offender is a classic pop song.  It's a song that belongs with the Only Ones, the Buzzcocks and all that was great about the two minute explosions that used to excite kids so long ago - yet it certainly doesn't sound dated.  There's a vocal wit present that's Ian Dury with a smattering of Half Man Half Biscuit (sorry lads!) - the kind of lyricism that makes the song stick in your head all day, following you around until you get back to the stereo to put it on just one more time, and if that doesn't catch you, the melody will.  It actually made me consider buying batteries for my dusty Walkman.<br><br>This play on words and deliberately infectious chorus is followed into Formica, the second track - another blistering epic at 1min45s - where every new line brings a wry smile.  The most noticeable aspect of the CD, though, is the restrained musicianship.  There's some wonderful guitar textures, and many subtle twists and hooks in the production to keep you interested, but they noticeably steer well clear of showboating.  The indulgence is all contained in the lyric and attitude of the music, where it belongs.  Even in the final track, 'Still Life', a mocking snipe at the pretence obsessed art world, there is plenty of scope to become a parody that is expertly dodged with more percussive and white-noise guitar fills between a disarmingly simple four-note melody.  In layman's terms, it rocks.<Br><br>If you've yet to hear Lorimer, it's a good time to catch them.  Despite their considerable experience in the industry, they still manage to churn out great singles without sounding jaded or tired - yet.  Get 'em while they're hot, kids, or you might regret it later!</p>
