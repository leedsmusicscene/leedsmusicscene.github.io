    <p>'If You Like To Dance' are an alternative pop duo from Warrington, currently based in Leeds, who combine synth' driven dance beats with the songwriting sensibilities of an indie-style guitar band.<br /><br />Their track 'Skin & Bone' from their forthcoming E.P, titled 'We Do Things Differently Here' which they have recently recorded with UK production team "Sugar House Music" is added to the BBC Radio 1 playlist! <br /><br />It will be played from the 3rd of June on the following shows, Monday: Sara Cox, Greg James, Dev, Scott Mills, Huw Stephens & Gemma Cairney.<br /><br />Influenced by artists such as Bloc Party and Two Door Cinema Club, who incorporate a dance element into their music, If You Like To Dance decided they wanted to take this idea a step further. Opting to use drum machines and mixing software with live vocals, bass and guitar, their performances have the driving momentum of a DJ set whilst retaining the organic feel of a live band.<br /><br />Their debut E.P, titled 'We Do Things Differently Here' will be available to download from all major online stores from 3rd June 2013.<br /><br />The music video for the song 'Skin & Bone' is now available on YouTube:<br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucqgx2o1nKE<br /><br />'If You Like to Dance' are appearing at 360 Club, The Library, Leeds on Friday 31st May.</p>
