    <p>This May Day weekend community radio station East Leeds FM launch their second 24 hour Musicathon.<br /><br />From 3pm on Saturday 1st May the Musicathon brings together a whole host of bands and performers from across Leeds for a musical spectacular, performed live from Seacroft Methodist Chapel.<br /><br />This year the Musicathon is a Live at Leeds fringe event. Broadcast live online from www.elfm.co.uk, the Musicathon continues through the night, bringing the best live local music direct to people's homes, long after the gigs have finished.<br /><br />Divided into 24 one hour programmes, this year promises some exciting collaborations and never heard before performances created exclusively for the occasion.<br /><br />Highlights include ELFM favourite Jon Gomm, Hope & Social and local band Germain. The event will also feature Rob Galloway 'Barefoot in the Chapel' for an hour of Acoustic Punk and showcases by local young people and community groups from East Leeds.<br /><br />Following last year's musical epic 'George and the Sea' the marvellous Maggie 8 will also return with a piece written especially for the Chapel. Tune in on Saturday evening for their world exclusive of 'Jurassic Park the Musical'!<br /><br />The Musicathon came about as a way to promote the wealth of musical talent in Leeds, and to create opportunities for local young people and amateur musicians to perform in collaboration with professional artists. Last year's event featured over 300 musicians! <br /><br />To find out more about the Musicathon go to www.elfm.co.uk and tune in over the Live at Leeds weekend from 3pm on Saturday 1st May.</p>
