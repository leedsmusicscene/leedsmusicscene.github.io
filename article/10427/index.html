    <p>NEWS<br /><br />05/03/2009 - We have just finished recording our EP which is free to download, you can also listen online at our MySpace page. Feel free to let us know what you think.<br />We've also just updated our gigs on there, of which a few are in Leeds so get yourselves down!<br /><br />There's a little bit more about us below.<br /><br />Members:<br /><br />John B - Guitar<br />Previously played in several bands including Bernard Kelly where I played drums for a year or so, then after moving on to guitar played in a band called Crimson Tide. Both of which played regularly around the Leeds/Bradford area.<br /><br />Andy - Guitar<br />Andy has played in a few bands in and around Leeds/Bradford, two of which were Greater Speed and Accuracy and Blacktop. Since then Andy has moved on to playing guitar where he has found his forte.<br /><br />Paddy - Drums<br />Although Paddy has not played in any bands he certainly knows his way around a kit. He's also pretty mean with a guitar which is always handy with writing new stuff.<br /><br />Kyle - Lead Vocals<br />The small peroxide Canadian has been a vocal presence in many a Leeds band including Get Jack Back and Cotheria, before finally finding his punk/disco warbles a home with A.D.<br /><br />Jonny - Bass guitar<br />The final member to join completing Accept Decline's line-up. Jonny has played bass for various outfits including Blackburn based punk band The Don-kiddicks and Leeds pop rockers Concrete Bullet. He is also a drum & bass producer when he has the time..</p>
