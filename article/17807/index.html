    <p>Xtra Mile Recordings are excited to announce the signing of "Rousing orchestral-folk" (The Guardian) marvels, To Kill A King and give details of the band's forthcoming album, as well as their 13-date October/November UK tour.<br /><br />The captivating, now London based five-piece (who are originally borne out of Leeds), are set to re-release their acclaimed album  'Cannibals With Cutlery'.  This will be a deluxe edition with four extra tracks.  The release date is set for October 7th through Xtra Mile Recordings; with first single 'Rays' also available as a digital download from October 7th. <br /> <br />You can pre-order the album from here:<br />Xtra Mile Recordings - http://bit.ly/1cvbAtl<br />iTunes - http://www.smarturl.it/99apm4 <br /><br />Ahead of this, To Kill A King are now offering the sublime 'Bones' (the first track they ever recorded together as a band) as a free download: <br /><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F103562093&color=ff6600&auto_play=false&show_artwork=true"></iframe><br /><br />Ralph Pelleymounter, TKAK says "We're so excited to be on the same label as artists like Frank Turner and Beans On Toast. I've always really admired the work they have done over the years as an independent"  <br /><br />Charlie Caplowe from Xtra Mile has added: "We are chuffed to bits to be working with TKAK. To see what they have achieved on their own is incredible and we are delighted to be working together with them to step things up even further and welcoming them into the XM clan." <br /><br />After a short European tour in August, the band will be performing at Reading and Leeds Festival (24th and 25th August respectively) and at Bestival on the Isle of Wight (5th-8th September). <br /><br />Then this autumn, they embark on their UK headline tour and will be hitting Leeds on Tue 22nd October, playing the Brudenell Social Club.
