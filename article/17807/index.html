I've always really admired the work they have done over the years as an independent"  <br /><br />Charlie Caplowe from Xtra Mile has added: "We are chuffed to bits to be working with TKAK. To see what they have achieved on their own is incredible and we are delighted to be working together with them to step things up even further and welcoming them into the XM clan." <br /><br />After a short European tour in August, the band will be performing at Reading and Leeds Festival (24th and 25th August respectively) and at Bestival on the Isle of Wight (5th-8th September). <br /><br />Then this autumn, they embark on their UK headline tour and will be hitting Leeds on Tue 22nd October, playing the Brudenell Social Club.
