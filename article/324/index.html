        <h1>Kaya - Poorly Produced Demo</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Poorly Produced Demo" recorded by Kaya. The review was written by Richard Garnett in 2003.</p>
    <p>"It'll be really funny and everyone will forgive our recording foibles if we call our demo 'Poorly Produced Demo' upfront - hey it's irony man!" Umm, well it isn't funny and it should really have been called 'Poorly Mastered Demo' lacking as it does in EQ or volume. In fact it's a disservice to producer (our very own) James Stringer who does a fair job of mixing and balancing levels on 3 rather straight pop/rock songs.<Br><Br>Unfortunately for Kaya the dynamics are not only missing from the flat sound but also from the flat song writing. "Dead to the world" offers the most of the 3 offerings but its Eurovision level chorus melody doesn't stick and things get a little long winded with a lack of editing. Proficient slap bass is not enough to rescue the charmingly named "Fat Motherfunker" and "Puppy Dog" is a forgettable closer despite a momentary highlight where the band stumble on to an AC/DC riff.<Br><Br>Kaya are not with out ideas and in time they will undoubtedly formulate these into material worthy of such titles as "The Really Good Demo".</p>
