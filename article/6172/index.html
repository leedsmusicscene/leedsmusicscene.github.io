    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for Josh Parker.</p>
    <p>Josh Parker hails from Halifax in West Yorkshire. He has lived here all his life. The music played was originally solo singer songwriter music, heavily influenced by Robert Johnson, Neil Young and Jeff Buckley. Through this diverse range of influences Josh began to develop a style that could not be fully expressed through the acoustic guitar. It was at this point that he recruited Danny Laycock (bass, guitar and piano) and Phil Bates (drums, guitar and piano).<br><br>These additions opened up a whole new set of ideas for Josh who now plays half acoustic, with some backing, and half electric sets with the rhythm section. Josh writes all his own music with the exception of a few covers, notably a much changed version of Michael Jacksonâ€™s Billie Jean. With the extra impetus gained from the two new members Josh will be doing as many local gigs as can be fitted in between working and is also currently coordinating a British tour for the summer..</p>
