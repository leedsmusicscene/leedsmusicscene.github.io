    <p>"All the shitty shows are gone, all the idiots screaming in the fucking wind are dead, I love it... leaving nothing but a cool, beautiful serenity called Arizona Bay." Bill Hicks<br /><br />Leeds' leading grunge revivalists Arizona Bay will release their new single 'Gadfly' on 18th November with a launch taking place at 360 Club at The Library, Leeds. <br /><br />A limited run of the single, which is taken from the band's debut album, 'Refuse', to be released next year, will be available at the launch and in both Crash Records and Jumbo Records in Leeds from November 18th. <br /><br />A digital release is planned with the single being made available on iTunes as well as other digital distributors.  <br /><br />After changing guitarists 8 months ago the band has moved from strength to strength. Gigging extensively on the national circuit, their charismatic live performances have seen them play a number of high-profile shows including a Friday headlining slot on a small stage at Leeds Festival as well as numerous sold out shows with 360 Club and BBC Introducing.<br /><br />Intensive writing, road-testing, and recording original material has allowed the band to form and hone their sound, a eclectic mix of angst driven energy and fury with a 90s-centric Alt. Rock aesthetic, whilst at times possessing a subtlety and dynamic awareness all too often lacking within the genre. <br /><br />The single launch night features a full bill of the best emerging talent on the Leeds and Yorkshire music scene. More details below.<br /><br />Fri 18th Nov<br />360 Club at The Library pub (upstairs)<br />Woodhouse Lane, LS2 3AP<br />Doors 8pm - 11.30pm<br />£4 adv- Jumbo records £5 on the door (18+)<br />Line-up: Arizona Bay, Resonance, The Calls, Penguin.</p>
