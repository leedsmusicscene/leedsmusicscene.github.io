    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for Glass Mountain.</p>
    <p>It would be easy for GLASS MOUNTAIN to refer to themselves as a Leeds band, to attach themselves to the vibrant and inventive landscape that city continues to foster. But no, GLASS MOUNTAIN are a Bradford band, proud of its heritage yet fully conscious of the neglect and under-investment their city has had to endure. Through adversity and austerity, however, great art often shines; and GLASS MOUNTAIN shine brilliantly.<br /><br />Formed one year ago from the broken ashes of several other bands, GLASS MOUNTAIN locked themselves away in a Bradford cellar, utilised every fibre of their remarkable passion and talent and created the GLACIAL EP and video.<br /><br />Influenced in no small part by the genius of David Hockney, one of Bradford's finest ambassadors, they took their name from one of the artist's etchings, and are bold and confident enough to have respectfully requested his personal blessing for their use of the name.<br /><br />GLASS MOUNTAIN clearly care passionately about what they create. There are five tracks on their debut EP, but GLASS MOUNTAIN have more of these songs in their armoury; songs that will be released when the time is right. For now, the debut EP is a statement of intent; a creation that may well still resonate in years to come..</p>
