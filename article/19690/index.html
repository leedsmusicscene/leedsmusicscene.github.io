    <p>CPWM Singles Club have announced that the 5th instalment in their series will be released in November.<br /><br />Described by Clash as "fast becoming an imprint to watch" Leeds label Come Play With Me has been highlighting the awesome diversity of great music coming out of the area. Previous singles have featured the likes of Cinerama, Harkin, Fizzy Blood, Officers, ZoZo, Esper Scout, Ceiling Demons and Maggie8.<br /><br />This single features new music from Her Name Is Calla and Deadwall. <br /><br />The first track from this single is the stunning 'Kaleidoscoping' from post-rock luminaries Her Name Is Calla which was unveiled yesterday on Gold Flake Paint.<br /><br />A self described "old band now" Her Name Is Calla have been quietly creating what NME have described as "massive, pastorally apocalyptic music" for over a decade, winning accolades and fans along the way with a cluster of acclaimed albums and tours with the likes of The Twilight Sad and I Like Trains.<br /><br />Listen to  'Kaleidoscoping' below.<br /><br /><iframe width="100%" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/286573068&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true"></iframe><br /><br /><br />Deadwall are an ambitious band, their music venturing from alternative indie to chamber pop via some knowing nods to 90's Shoegaze College rock. Their contribution is the driving, focussed guitar pop of 'The Talk'. <br /><br />The new single will be released on the 25th November, with a single launch at the Brudenell Social Club in Leeds on the 26th.</p>
