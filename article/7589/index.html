        <h1>The Plight - s/t</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "s/t" recorded by The Plight. The review was written by Daniel Powell in 2006.</p>
    <p>There are plenty of things to like about The Plight’s debut release. Whether it be the darkly themed artwork, the knowingly sarcastic lyrics or the old skool riffage, there is something here for everyone to get into. Right from the off there are enough things right with this record to know that The Plight will go far. Mixing biting social commentary with raucous gutter-punk and a retro edge is certainly novel, especially in these heady days of metal-core, screamo, and any other identikit genre currently clogging up the radio waves. Whilst there are plenty of decent bands within these genres, they are not doing anything new, and that’s where The Plight come in. Their sound sits somewhere between the guttural attack of Black Flag and the drunken swing of Thin Lizzy, all the while managing to sound fresh and retain their own identity. After such a short career they have already been picked up by a label, toured the country and seen their name in many a rock magazine, and things haven’t even kicked off yet.<br><br>A highlight from this release is live favourite “Ball and Chain”, a swinging, swigging anthem set to a massive bass line with one of the best chorus lines ever: “you wear a ball and chain BABY!” Elsewhere there's lots to love, from the riotous opening track “Talk is Cheap” right through to sublime closer “Life’s Debt”, there are riffs-a-plenty and a shout along chorus at every turn. The most impressive thing, however, is that in vocalist Al Mancrief they have an icon in waiting as their frontman. With more charisma than a party in full swing, the man is a hidden treasure.<br><br>Put simply The Plight are one of the greatest bands to emerge from Leeds in a long time. Not as pretentious as, say, The Music or Kaiser Chiefs, with enough integrity and a damn near perfect repertoire of songs, they can’t possibly fail. Plan Z… I love Plan Z.</p>
