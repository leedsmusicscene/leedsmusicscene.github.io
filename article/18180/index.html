    <p>Bringing together some of the most relevant, important and historic venues around the country, Independent Venue Week (supported by PRS for Music) is a 6 day long series of gigs running from 28th January through to the 2nd February 2014.<br /><br />Independent venues sit at the heart of their local community, providing a vital lifeline to upcoming artists early in their careers whilst bringing together those fans who are passionate about live music. With more and more small to medium sized venues continuing to close around the country, Independent Venue Week supports those venues that play such a significant role to musicians and fans alike.<br /><br />IVW want to celebrate the venues, and the people that run them, that have played host to some of the biggest names in music when they were no better known than the bands that are playing there now.  In this inaugural year, each of the 18 participating venues will host one night over the course of the week as their official Independent Venue Week gig.<br /><br />As part of the Independent Venue Week, the 360 Club (which takes place at The Library in Leeds) will host headliners Allusondrugs, a 5-piece alternative rock band from Castleford,  Forever Cult, who are celebrating their single launch, Fizzler and Perfect Crimes<br /><br />Doors open at 8pm and tickets cost Â£5 (adv).<br /><br /><iframe width="640" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/seaLc4vgOPI?feature=player_embedded" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
