        <h1>The Lies - Untitled</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Untitled" recorded by The Lies. The review was written by Richard Garnett in 2006.</p>
    <p>The careful listener will notice that there are actually 3 tracks on The Lies new offering but the tendency to segway between songs of a similar structure, tempo, sound and key will have the casual listener feeling as if they have wandered into a mod-rock-opera. The jury is therefore out on this tactic but there can be little doubt about the verdict on the charge of high tempo energy and general guitar led excitement. Half of former Leeds mod-sters Uptight and although not totally abandoning their routes the band now have a blues and garage-soul sound (reminiscent of the ill-fated lead balloons Mo Solid Gold). Knothing Knowing and Drowning work so well together because they do sound like two parts of the same song. It’s highly polished stuff but only on closer 7AM does the band really find a head turning moment adding a dose of “catchy” to the energy previously on offer. With a few more hooks in their tool belt The Lies would be preaching the truth.</p>
