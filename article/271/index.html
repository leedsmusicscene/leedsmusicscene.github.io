        <h1>Chilli - Killing Me</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Killing Me" recorded by Chilli. The review was written by Richard Garnett in 2003.</p>
    <p>Now here's a novel idea, a CD single (a format predominantly bought by a 11-16 girls) that contains the purest "adult" orientated rock I've heard in a long time. This is music born and bred in local pub gigs, where the most popular choices on the jukebox include Alana Myles - Black Velvet, and Cher - If I could turn back time.<br><br>Chilli employ the Garbage tactic of an attractive female vocalist who distracts from the "slightly on the old side" male band members. You just know that one of them wears black leather trousers at gigs. Ludicrously someone compared Chilli to The Cardigans (yes, they all have legs) or The Cranberries (in the same way Tina Turner can be?).<br><br>From start to finish this is inoffensive mild mannered blues-pub-rock. It's hard to knock, as it is so lovingly played, produced and packaged but you really think the band would have bothered to turn on Radio 1 or even 2 at some point in the past year. The closest to a modern influence comes in the direct rip off of David Gray's 'Debauchery' in title track "Killing Me", it's uncanny.<br><br>One thing Chilli are not is cool, just the temperature of the perfect pint down your local...luke warm.
