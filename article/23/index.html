        <h1>Tempting Kate - Falling Off Buildings</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Falling Off Buildings" recorded by Tempting Kate. The review was written by Dave Sugden in 2001.</p>
    <p>The latest release, "Falling Off Buildings", has confirmed my faith in the ability of Leeds/Stirling outfit Tempting Kate to knock out some excellent indie guitar-pop songs.  Their previous release "Waiting For Nothing" returned top review after top review, and this one will be no different.<br><bR>"Eating Concrete" opens up the CD, and is a little heavier than their usual delivery, but still... it's excellent.  Scarily suitable harmonies, a mix of heavy distortion and soaring pop moments in the guitars and a general feeling of "could this get any better?"<BR><Br>Well, yes.  The title track follows and is the classic indie pop tune on the CD, yet it still utilises a nice'n'dirty guitar and bass sound.  Writing danceable, bouncy, pogotastic tracks is obviously why Tempting Kate was formed: "When you watch me falling off buildings, Do you know you're still my saviour, I can watch you watching me falling, Never need to return that favour".<Br><br>In my last review I said that "if they fail to get national recognition it will be a major travesty" and I stand by that.  If you like Idlewild, you will like Tempting Kate, a band that stand up very well to their signed equivalents. </p>
