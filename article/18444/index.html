    <p>Organisers at Bingley Music Live have this week announced their final line-up additions for their August 2014 event.

The Pet Shop Boys attendance is a real coup for Bingley Music Live as it is the only UK festival appearance for the six times Grammy nominees in their five mainland UK dates of their Electric World Tour. <br /><br />Not only jam packed with some of the biggest acts of today, Bingley Music Live is celebrating the twentieth anniversary of Britpop with acts like Shed Seven, former Supergrass frontman, Gaz Coombes, and Simon and Oscar from Ocean Colour Scene as they deliver amazing acoustic versions of some of the band's greatest hits.<br /><br />The very best of new talent is represented this year with acts like MNEK who is on an incredible rise and recognised by just about everyone in the music industry as about to blow up stellar, and Jess Glynne the singer behind two of the biggest hits of the year having appeared on Clean Bandit's and Route 94's massive Number Ones.<br /><br />Guitars are back at Bingley with a charge led by The Strypes, Catfish and the Bottlemen, Eliza and the Bear, Dexters and The Mispers, whilst The Selecter add some class heritage to the lineup that includes pop troubadours Chloe Howl, Bipolar Sunshine and Young Kato. Singer Songwriters Nick Mulvey and Charlie Cunningham now join John Lennon McCullagh on the bill.<br /><br />The best of the current urban and dance scenes are represented with Sam Smith partner Naughty Boy making an appearance as well as Gorgon City, Etta Bond, Joel Compass.<br /><br />The festival even has the changeovers covered with sets from Ultimate Power, legendary music journalist Simon Price, Pet Sounds, and Bingley stalwart Joel Young, whilst Goldblade frontman John Robb will compere the event.<br /><br />Bingley Music Live takes place in Myrtle Park across the weekend of August 29th - 31st.<br /><br />Tickets for Bingley Music Live 2014 can be purchased from See Tickets.</p>
