    <p>Hot off the heels of Centre Stage winning Hospice UK's 2014 National Award for 'Innovation in Income Generation', 2015's competition is now open for registration. <br /><br />Martin House Children's Hospice, together with Reading & Leeds Festivals, have begun their new search for the region's act who will ultimately claim the prize of playing at both sites at next summer's Reading & Leeds Festivals.<br /> <br />The competition continues to receive involvement and support from Yorkshire bands Embrace, Pigeon Detectives, The Cribs and Pulled Apart by Horses. Now in its sixth year, organisers are putting the call out once again for young bands and soloists, of any genre, to enter.<br /><br />Over the coming months, registered acts will undertake their own fundraising for Martin House, who witness the therapeutic benefits of music first hand within the hospice. Once registered, acts will be automatically entered into the Heats, which will take place on 28-30th April at the Belgrave Music Hall, Leeds. <br /><br />The selected finalists will then take to the stage at O2 Academy, Leeds, on 22nd July 2015, following a professional mentoring day.<br /><br />The competition is an invaluable link to the local music industry, especially those supportive of unsigned, young artists. It has provided connections and opportunities for many contenders, and 2012 finalists Carnabells played Glastonbury Festival 2014 and previous winners have taken to the road and supported both The Pigeon Detectives and Embrace.<br /><br />To enter, please register online on the Martin House website at www.martinhouse.org.uk/Centre-Stage. Participants must be between 11- 21 years old and from North or West Yorkshire (other T&Cs apply, please read the site before you apply).</p>
