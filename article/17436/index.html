    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2013.</p>
    <p>'Crawl' is the second single from Witch Hunt, the Leeds based duo of Louisa Osborn and Chris Mulligan, and is another spark of the black magic that has seen them much talked about on the thriving West Yorkshire music scene.<br /><br />The self produced title track shows a softer side to their sound but an equally alluring and all the more menacing wit. Tension builds with expert poise as Louisa's angelic voice haunts swirling guitars, sinister lyrics creep up on her prey capturing their will before they can realise what lies within, another listener is under her spell.<br /><br />Continuing the blues stomp of their d√©but single, B-side 'Polly' is an ode to an inspiration, a certain PJ Harvey has played no small part in Witch Hunt's journey. The jangling guitars echo on this basement demo whilst the sheer power of the voice contained within Louisa's slight frame springs forth, smothering Chris' hushed backing and everything else in its path.<br /><br />A third track rewards the keenest listeners, available only on the limited edition poster wrapped CD version of the single, "I'm finding it harder to be a gentleman" will sound familiar to anyone particularly fond of the works of Jack White III. Wearing their hearts on their sleeves Witch Hunt have been known to step out as the famous twosome in red and white under the moniker "Witch Stripes" and wowed a capacity crowd recently headlining the famous Brudenell Social Club's NYE party.<br /><br />'Crawl' is released on 22nd April 2013 on Leeds-based independent label Dead Young Records. As well as digital download in trademark style it will be on limited edition (200 copies) hand packaged, poster wrapped CDs bound with string. Available from independent record shops, online and at the band's live shows.<br /><br />Since their sold out debut launch Witch Hunt have wowed audiences alongside Wolf Alice, Veronica Falls, LULS and a stunning show at Leeds' grade I listed Holy Trinity Church at Christmas. They will be heading out in support of the single with dates scheduled for Wakefield and Leeds.<br /><br />You can listen to the single below:<br /><br /><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F82972927"></iframe><br /><br />Watch the video for 'Crawl' here:<br /><br /><iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/PEglJql9Odc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
