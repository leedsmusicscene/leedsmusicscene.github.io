    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for CobraKiss.</p>
    <p>CobraKiss were originally formed in 2007 by Tommy Cobra and Cal Saxton. The band has been playing gigs regularly for 2 years but has gone through several major lineup changes.<br /><br />The current lineup is the strongest yet and is completed by students from Huddersfield Uni!<br /><br />The first member to join the original two members of CobraKiss was guitarist Robin Bladez. Robin used to be the lead guitarist of the Southern/Hard Rock band 'The Blackjacks' who unfortunately split when Robin moved to Huddersfield.<br /><br />The next member to join was drummer Dan who had come from a metal background with pounding double bass beats as well as the groove based beats which give our songs a unique feel!<br /><br />The lineup was completed by bassist Harry Boam or Boa as we like to call him! Harry comes from a very musical background, having played and written in various styles from Guns n' Roses to Prog Rock and Metal!<br /><br />CobraKiss have been working on writing new material which has been coming along nicely! To best hear the music come to one of our January/February shows! Our music is best heard live! Just as music is meant to be!.</p>
