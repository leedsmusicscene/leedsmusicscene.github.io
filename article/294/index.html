        <h1>Cactus - Untitled</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Untitled" recorded by Cactus. The review was written by Richard Garnett in 2003.</p>
    <p>Bands should always be wary of using such words as "distinctive" in their biog as it always gives reviewers a cheap way in. Particularly, as with Cactus, when it's not an applicable adjective. This 3 song demo does it's best to lay dreary offerings at the temples of Soundgarden and Alice In Chains. As "recent victors of a local battle of the bands" it can only be assumed that Cactus are far more adept at selling their wares live than on CD.<bR><br>"Take A Ride" has the most life about it but the cringe worthy adlibbed "Oh Yeah's", "Ugh's" & "Come on's" are only slightly less detestable than if the lines ended with the words "hey man" or "baby". "Tape Me Up" and "Last Train" are as disjointed as they are dull, sadly lacking the melodic sensibilities of the afore mentioned influences, replacing them with overblown angst. Vocalist Scott pulls of some "stars in their eyes" level impersonations of Chris Cornell, pronouncing all his 'O's as 'Aww's but it hinders rather than helps.<bR><br>All said and done this is one Cactus that has yet to form some sharp spines.</p>
