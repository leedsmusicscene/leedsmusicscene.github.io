        <h1>Shatner - Anticlockwise</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Anticlockwise" recorded by Shatner. The review was written by Russell Leeming in 2006.</p>
    <p>BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM!!<br><br>No it’s not Basil Brush, but the sheer amount of influences bursting from Shatner’s confident double A side single. Encapsulating all the positives of Britpop, ‘Anticlockwise’ is a memorable tune that sounds like a coming together of Super Furry Animals and Supergrass, with Elbow’s Guy Garvey on vocals. Kula Shaker, Sleeper and Ocean Colour Scene are thankfully not invited.<br><br>Lyrically, it’s not the most enticing thing you’ll ever hear (“I think we’re growing up / I think we’re growing down / going round and round and round the wrong way round”), but who cares? Sometimes the world gets fed up of being told that “George Bush is a bad man” and “ultimate misery will be by our sides forever” etc etc. With this however, you can practically hear the beer boys singing along (“It’s tii-ii-ii-ii-ime”). A good thing, because life is about having fun, is it not?<br><br>The most appealing thing about Shatner (aside from sounding a bit like the Kaiser Chiefs and not being irritating), is that they can be the most indie band ever and still sound original; like a chef mixing up the same old ingredients to create a brand new dish. This shows in the immediacy of ‘It’s Time’; it sounds like something the Kaisers or Blur (Great Escape era) chucked away, but has since been found in better hands and turned into a good tune, but without the novelty element.<br><br>Okay, it’s far from being life changing but my life’s pretty much fine thank you very much. A solid eight, no mistakes and it’ll be interesting to see what Shatner do next. Please no “ooohs” and “ahhhs” though. Semicolon, hyphen, closed bracket.<br><br>Fun fun fun.</p>
