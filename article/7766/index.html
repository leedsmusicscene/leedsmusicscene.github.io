        <h1>Kaiser Chiefs to release a new single and album in the New Year</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2006.</p>
    <p>Leeds bands Kaiser Chiefs have today revealed details of a new single, the band’s first single release since “Modern Way” in November 2005.<br><br>“Ruby” will be released on Monday 19th February 2007 on the B-Unique Records label and will come in both limited edition 7” and CD formats. A Digital Download format will be available one week earlier (12th February).<br><br>The single is the first to be taken from the band’s new album, the follow up to the chart-topping and award-winning “Employment” album. The 13-track new album is currently scheduled for release on Monday, 26th February 2007. To coincide with the album the band have announced that they will be touring the UK, although dates and venue details have yet to be revealed.<br><br>It’s been a remarkable year for the Leeds five-piece: the band received three Brit Awards; were honoured by NME with “Album of 2005“; received an Ivor Novello Award; and sold almost 3 million copies of their debut album. So keep your eyes and ears open for the new releases in 2007... you can hear the first play of “Ruby” on Radio One on 8th January.</p>
