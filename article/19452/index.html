    <p>Long Division Festival has added a further 22 bands to the bill for 2016's festival in June. Already announced for the festival are Mercury Prize nominated Sunderland brothers Field Music, Leeds post punk legends Gang Of Four, the hugely influential The Membranes, The Fall survivors/ex-members Brix & The Extricated and former Delgado Emma Pollock.<br /> <br />Building on this already excellent line up, Long Division have announced a brace of new acts that help it along its way to becoming one of the best celebrations of DIY music and culture around... including Brighton's acclaimed Fear of Men, alongside much hyped Indie darlings Kagoule, fast rising local heroes Allusondrugs, and Glasgow's Chemikal Underground icon RM Hubbert who makes his long awaited return to Wakefield.<br /><br />Partnering with Music Glue to run an artist application process for acts to put themselves up for consideration to play Long Division has resulted in a huge amount of exciting artists sending their music to the festival. Louise Distras, Buen Chico, Cold Summer, Fold, The Homesteads, Big Love, The Do's, Heather Coulton, Piles Of Clothes, The Passing Fancy have all been selected to perform at the festival through the platform, joining previously announced Music Glue acts Habberdash, Jack Winn, Yawning Dog, One Day, After School... and Milk Crimes.<br /><br />Long Division will host 90 bands across 7 venues in Wakefield city centre over the weekend of the 10th to 12th June 2016. Tickets can be bought from the Long Division website.</p>
