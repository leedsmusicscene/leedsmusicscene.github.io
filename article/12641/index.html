    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2010.</p>
    <p>'Slow As An Eyeball' is the début album from Yorkshire-based instrumental trio Quack Quack and will be released on the Cuckundoo Records label on 10th May 2010.<br /><br />The band worked with Spectrum's Richard Formby (Wild Beasts, Hood and Mogwai) at his predominantly analogue studio in Leeds and the album was recorded over a three-year period. Recording was straight to tape, with very little in the way of post-production, as Quack Quack aimed to capture the live sound and vibrant energy that dazzled crowds at gigs with the likes of Deerhoof, Jeffrey Lewis and Scout Niblett.<br /><br />The album track listing is:<br /><br />1 Perpetual Spinach<br />2 D Motherfucker D<br />3 Three<br />4 Toc H<br />5 Phonehenge<br />6 Big Sounds<br />7 Cakes Are Easy<br />8 Bird Parliament<br />9 As Slow As An Eyeball<br />10 Jack Of None<br /><br />Quack Quack will appear live in Leeds on Saturday 8th May as part of the<br />Chinchilla Festival at the Brudenell Social Club.</p>
