        <h1>Itch - Untitled</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Untitled" recorded by Itch. The review was written by Paul Geary in 2004.</p>
    <p>Four-track demo of angular post emo from this Batley 4 piece. The band unashamedly wear their influences on their sleeves. Spy Vs Spy, The Wow, and Little Explorer all immediately spring to mind.<bR><br>On earlier offering "The Boy Who Cried Wolf" I had a real problem with the vocals, Mr Milner's voice just grated on me, and I'm glad to say these new tracks had no such problem. The vocals now have a new found maturity that seemed to be lacking previously. The drawn out portions of angst screaming have been reduced to a minimum which leaves us with Mr Milner's well crafted singing voice, from light twinkly melodies to full on screaming drawl, the balance is there, which over the intricately formed angular (that word again) guitar and bass proves for a much more listenable erm... listen.
