        <h1>"Jon Gomm Presents..." series of gigs in Leeds</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2010.</p>
    <p>Leeds' own guitar virtuoso Jon Gomm, described by Acoustic Magazine as "One of the world's most gifted and inspirational guitar players", is hosting a series of six special concerts in Leeds. <br /><br />Jon has been touring the length and breadth of Britain for the past few years, and has met some fantastic musicians along the way. With this project, which he's called "Jon Gomm Presents...", Jon has invited his favourite artists from around the country to come to Leeds and perform with him in front of his home crowd. <br /><br />The concerts will be held monthly at The Grove Inn, Holbeck, starting on Saturday October 30th with Jon's first guest being the local legend, Brendan Croker: Notting Hillbilly and long-time cohort of Mark Knopfler. "Brendan started off this idea of collaborative concerts in 2004, so I thought I'd better invite him to play the first one!" Jon explains. "And the Notting Hillbillies' first ever gig was at The Grove, so it couldn't be more fitting. The Grove is the spiritual home of acoustic music in Leeds and always provides a thrilling atmosphere."<br /><br />The format of the concerts will see Jon playing an opening set, his guest playing a set, and then the two playing a combined set together at the end as a unique finale that should make each concert truly memorable.<br /><br />Jon's guest for the following concert (November 27th) will be Grammy Award winning Indian musician Amrit Sond, and future guests are equally exciting prospects. <br /><br />Tickets for the shows can be purchased at jongomm.com or wegottickets.com and are priced at £5.</p>
