    <p>Biography<br /><br />Brett Lee Started Writing Song around 5 years ago, his inspiration? Writing songs from his heart. Songs about peoples problems, his own or friends and relatives around him. As a shy little kid he decided it was time to step out of his bedroom and let the public finally see what he was creating. <br /><br />After Entering local competitions and being victorious he decided to enter the competition "Live and U<br />nsigned 2010".<br /> <br />After Making it all the way threw to the Area Finals singing his own creations, and managing to make it to the final 100 out of 10 000 entries he just missed out on a place at the final at the o2 area in London. <br /><br />Success in the competition led to a Live performance on Real Radio's Breakfast show and the urge to start a new chapter.<br /> <br />The Band "Northern Torch" was created. The band was made to work closely on the songs Brett was writing and a year of successful gigs followed. It was a busy year. The release of the E.P "Scream" online,  being filmed and recorded live by BBC Introducing and a music video for ''Take My Hand'' was produced.<br /> In August 2011 unfortunately the band parted company due to other commitments.<br /><br />Brett Lee bounced back, After the successful release of his Debut Solo EP 'For The Taking' back in 2013, which received plaudits from the music press, regular radio play and was championed by BBC Introducing.<br />Brett Lee was also invited to record a live session on the BBC Introducing show. <br /><br />After a short spell of writing, Brett Lee is back with his 1st single "When We Were Young" from the self-titled EP which is to be released in October..</p>
