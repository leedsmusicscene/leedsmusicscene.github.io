    <p>Headingly based electro band I Call Shotgun have returned victorious from the Snowbombing Festival in Mayhoffen, Austria where they won the 'King of the Mountain' national battle of the bands competition.<br><br>The band said, “We couldn't believe it when we won as the standard was so high with some of the bands already being well established and having supported big named acts such as Muse, The Kooks and The Magic Numbers. It was really cool to be on the same bill as The Pigeon Detectives, Calvin Harris, The Foals, Friendly Fires and Madness!”<br><br>As winners, the band received €2,000 and each band member went away with a new Windows touch screen phone.<br><br>In other news, I Call Shotgun have been selected as the house band for Switch with Nick Grimshaw on BBC Radio One this Sunday from 7-10pm.</p>
