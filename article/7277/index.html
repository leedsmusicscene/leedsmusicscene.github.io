    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for these.walls.have.ears.</p>
    <p>I started this project in May 2006. I’ve been in a rock band for countless years, and I wanted to know what it felt like to be in total control of the music, as well as push my personal boundaries to new limits. No pressure, and a completely blank canvas...<Br><br>I’ve no idea exactly where this music has come from. But whatever it is, it has been a channel through which I can express myself in new ways, and I have loved every minute! I have started of slowly & kept it as simple as possible, but I have a lot of things I want to try out and a lot of things I want to say in the future through my music.<bR><br>So I guess I am creating some kind of moody alternative electro-dance music with multi-layered vocals, creating uplifting yet reflective sounds, with often political lyrics which are straight from the heart. I plan on involving any musicians who would like to be involved, there’s an open invitation! There will be remixes of other artists & guest appearances along the way. Once there is something more solid established, there may be some kind of live presentation. This would be the ultimate, but for now it’s one step at a time....</p>
