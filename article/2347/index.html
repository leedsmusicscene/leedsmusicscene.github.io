    <p class="lead">This is a review of "I am New Mexico" recorded by The Breech. The review was written by Holden DeForge in 2004.</p>
    <p>A hectic lifestyle means that it has taken me a good week or two to actually get round to playing this CD. As I crank it up I wish I had found the time earlier. This is top quality stuff, opener 'Digging Holes' has some atmospheric keyboards that float in and out as the rhythm of the drums and the guitar give an almost slowed down drum and bass vibe to proceedings. Davoc Bradley has a fine voice and the vocal melodies throughout this mini album are strong and memorable. A lot of care and attention has gone into the arrangements of these songs. It's all good pop/rock with a dash of the aforementioned dance element.<Br><Br>It's not really an accurate comparison but I'm left with the impression that this is what Coldplay would sound like if they cheered up a bit and hit the distortion a little more often. The songs are well produced and the band keep things nice and tight. Bradley's voice is allowed to shine and 'Chasing The Sun' is a song that could easily dent the Top 40. 'My Missile' could penetrate the Top 20. There are some good songs here for sure but perhaps too many peaks and troughs, a little more consistency to keep things at their highest level and this is a band you will hear much more from. The Breech are certainly on the right path though and this is a CD you should certainly give a spin as it contains some well crafted and superbly played tunes.</p>
