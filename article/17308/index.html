        <h1>Boy on a Pedestal - Don't Walk Away</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Don't Walk Away" recorded by Boy on a Pedestal. The review was written by Harry Bedford in 2013.</p>
    <p>After the prestige of having their initial demo, Caroline, featured on BBC introducing, Leeds/Halifax-based indie outfit, Boy on a Pedestal headed to the studio to record their first single, Don't Walk Away. The band have a strong sound and production on this record that elevates them from the more amateurish music on the scene. Laid back, easy-going almost lethargic, a song to listen to as the sun sets. Nevertheless the tight rhythmical backing creates a brightly-coloured musical bed. The vocals, by Jimmy Sweeney, are distinctive and the melody, although not wide-ranging, suits him well. The song delivers ups and downs that nicely contrast each other and the chorus supplies a suitable hook for the indie aesthetic. There are elements of the Manchester scene of the late 80s/early 90s on this record as well as the thriving indie scene of the mid-00s. Definitely a band to keep an eye on over the coming months. Boy on a Pedestal will play Escobar in Leeds on February 23rd and Retro Bar in Manchester on March 30th.</p>
