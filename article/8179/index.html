    <p>Sinclair - Vocals/Guitar<br />
Paul - Bass<br />
Daz - Lead Guitar<br />
Cornell - Drums<br />
<br />
In 2005 brothers Paul and Darren joined forces with Cornell and Furious George was born. During the next few months the Halifax based trio practiced alongside various temporary members and mixing their creative influences developed a unique sound. The boys continued to play together and to make progress. However Cornell was begining to become tired of singing and playing the drums as well. Deciding that they needed a front man the boys enlisted the assistance of their friend Sinclair. After a few sessions things began to really fall into place and within no time Furious George began to play at functions around West Yorkshire and in venues such as Halifax's Fagins Bar. <br />
In time the boys realised that they had a real opportunity to progress with some of their own material and Departure and She Said were born. Unfortunately Furious George realised that they would have to change their names for copyright reasons if they wanted to progress with their own material and after much deliberation, 16 Days was born! The lads made their first recording in summer 2006. They recorded "Departure" and a live version of "She Said" at Halifax College recording studio. They also made some of their own recordings at their practice room. Deciding they needed some better quality records, they booked into Huddersfields HD1 recording studio in January 2007. Under the guidence of top audio engineer Jason Salisbury the recorded their two most recent songs "Break It Down" and "Let Me". <br />
Recently, the boys fought off some tough competition from great local bands to successfully win Halifax's 2007 'Battle of the Bands.' They have also enjoyed great receptions from music lovers in the area at venues such as: The Mixing Tin, Odsal Stadium, Royal Park Cellars, The New Roscoe, The Primrose and The Puzzle..</p>
