        <h1>Micky P Kerr announces release of long awaited debut album</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2016.</p>
    <p>Leeds' very own mercurial musical renaissance man Micky P Kerr has announced the release of his long-awaited debut album Kerr In The Kerrmunity on Friday 11th March. In keeping with a polymathic approach to his career over the last decade the release is split into three separate albums containing free-wheeling guitar pop, spoken word social commentary and tongue in cheek comedy material.<br /><br />Kerr has never done things the traditional way, the predictable way or the easy way. A celebrated stalwart of the vibrant Leeds music scene for ten years, he's released a string of EPs & singles that were playlisted on Radio 1, Radio 2, 6Music, Absolute Radio & XFM. Influential tastemakers like Huw Stephens, Steve Lamacq, Gideon Coe, Lauren Laverne, John Kennedy, Alex Lester and Tom Robinson have sung his praises on air and invited Micky to perform live radio sessions. Festival crowds were wowed at Leeds Festival, Kendal Calling, Blissfields & Live At Leeds as well as sold out audiences at headline shows around the UK. He seemed primed for a mainstream breakthrough, but the last few years have seen Micky focus more on an award-winning stand up comedy career in place of rock n' roll stardom.  Now however, his new music and material brims with a sense of renewed purpose and ambition.<br /><br />A Micky P Kerr live performance can contain wistful folk rock, acerbic political satire, bubblegum pop-punk, heartfelt poetry, raucous comedy songs - or anything in between. Backed by a revolving cast of local musicians and friends, Kerr In The Kerrmunity draws all of these disparate elements together into An Album Of Serious Music, An Album Of Comedic Songs and An Album Of Spoken Word. It's a defining statement that illustrates his talents as a songwriter, musician, raconteur, showman, comedian and poet.<br /><br />To accompany the new album announcement, Kerr is streaming a taster track for An Album Of Serious Music on Soundcloud. Victim is an infectious power-pop stomper tailor made for radio and festival singalongs. <br /><br /><iframe width="100%" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/237482804&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true"></iframe></p>
