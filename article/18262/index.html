    <p class="lead">This is a review of "I don't want to make you happy, I want to make you cry" recorded by The Grand. The review was written by Sian Goodwin in 2014.</p>
    <p>Wakefield's The Grand got their big break last year when they played the BBC Introducing stage at Leeds and Reading festival and have since gone on to release their 2-track EP titled 'I don't want to make you happy, I want to make you cry'.<br /><br />The EP is rather impressive, with credible lyrics that admittedly, I didn't expect from a small band from Wakefield. Describing themselves as 'transatlantic indie-pop' their songs are very catchy, with chorus's you can imagine echoing around any festival crowd. <br /><br />Conveying quite a sombre tone throughout, the emotive title-track gives a strong sense that not only are the heartfelt vocals lyrics in a song, but words with a real meaning behind them. This vibe continues in the second track 'All of the Ocean', this time armed with strong (but not over-powering) guitar riffs and moody, yet moving lyrics. <br /><br />They deserve to be recognized as more than just a Yorkshire indie-band, but a bloody good Yorkshire indie-band! Definitely worth a listen, their album is due to be released this year, so check them out.<br /><br /><iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3360468800/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="http://thegrandwakefield.bandcamp.com/album/i-dont-want-to-make-you-happy-i-want-to-make-you-cry">I Don&#39;t Want To Make You Happy I Want To Make You Cry by The Grand</a></iframe></p>
