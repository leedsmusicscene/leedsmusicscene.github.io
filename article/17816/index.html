        <h1>NARCS - Two Birds, One Stone Later</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Two Birds, One Stone Later" recorded by NARCS. The review was written by Cat Keller in 2013.</p>
    <p>Leeds' Alt-Rock quartet NARCS (Clue Records) are to release their début album 'Two Birds, One Stone Later' next month (2nd September). True to their word the album is pretty alternative with rage dressed in bold colours. These lads are pretty angsty, but not in an aggressive way; their moods come out in the music, heavy at moments to softer like Walls Ice Cream. What I'm trying to say is that they're controlled; everything fits in, with well-structured tracks and I do like their writing style. Especially fourth track 'Creatures': the opening to this track is somewhat atmospheric and a little different to the previous tracks. Vocalist, Wilko, shows us he has a voice inside all that gritty rage. Like a lion in a bunny outfit. (Someone stop me) <br /><br />I'm starting to like this band, after a few listens it's surely grown on me and 'Two Birds, One Stone Later' is clearly an example of a band producing something which is different to the usual drivel which comes out of the radio at 6am but still appealing to the masses. A band's nightmare when releasing a début is to think, "oh, will people actually like what we've spend so much time on?" and the answer from LMS to NARCS is yes. You've won me over.</p>
