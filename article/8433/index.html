    <p>MezzoFilms has celebrated the launch of its new promo division - Poison Pen Films - with the release of The Pigeon Detectives’ latest video. The new music promo company Poison Pen Films has created the video for the re-release of the Leeds band’s first single ‘I’m Not Sorry’. Released on 21st May this will be the first video produced by the division.<br><br>Directors at MezzoFilms say Poison Pen Films has been formed to cope with the increasing demand the company has faced for music promos over the past few years. Throughout its twenty year history MezzoFilms has produced a wide range of videos for musicians such as Graham Coxon and Young Knives. In fact MezzoFilms’ roots have always been firmly planted in music; the company’s founder Mike Scott is a multi BAFTA winning composer and as the company has grown into a production house to rival any London outfit, music has remained a strong service offering alongside animation, interactive, film, commercials and programming.<bR><br>The video for ‘I’m Not Sorry’ features The Pigeon Detectives smashing up a car with their guitars. Paul Morricone, Director at Poison Pen Films reveals; “It’s certainly a great video to announce Poison Pen Films with. When planning the video we didn’t actually have to source the main prop, the car, as it belonged to the singer’s girlfriend. We did ask her permission before we smashed it up though!”<br><br>Watch the 'I'm Not Sorry' video online here.<br><br>Watch a Poison Pen Films showreel online here.</p>
