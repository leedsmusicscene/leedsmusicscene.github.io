    <p>The Marmozets (now just Marmozets) are a 5 piece band hailing from Bingley, West Yorkshire. They formed in late 2007 at school and since then they have taken the Bradford music scene by storm winning 3 local Battle of the bands competitions. They have also made an impact at a national level by winning the Music for Youth Rock Section which culminated in the band performing at the World's largest youth music festival held at the Royal Albert Hall in front of 6000 people!  <br /><br />So far they have played lots of gigs around Bradford, Joseph's Well in Leeds, Carling Academy 2 in Birmingham and the Royal Albert Hall. They have supported local Bradford underground favourites "Random Hand" and also Irish Rock outfit "And So I Watch You From Afar" and are supporting "White Light Parade" in the near future. They have recorded two local radio sessions and have recently been mentored by Mike Heaton (drummer from Embrace) as part of a council funded scheme and have had one of their tracks included on a compilation album of Bradford's most promising bands. <br /><br />Their sound is way beyond their years (average age of 16) and they describe it as "poppy but heavy". Their debut EP was recorded at Soundworks studio in Leeds and is sure to reinforce their growing reputation as one of the most promising young bands in the area.  <br /><br />"They are some talent" Mike Heaton, Embrace<br /><br />"Really good, lots of energy" Will Jackson, Producer (Pigeon Detectives, Kaiser Chiefs +)<br /><br />"Marmozets best in UK" Bradford Telegraph & Argus headline<br /><br />"Destined to be huge" Joseph's Well, Leeds live review<br /><br />"Talented as f**k" Leeds Music Forum<br /><br />"Big things await these guys and gal" Gassienda live review <br /><br />The members are; <br /><br />Becca Macintyre - Vocals<br />Jack Bottomley - Lead Guitar<br />Sam Macintyre - Bass<br />Joe Doherty - Rhythm Guitar<br />Josh Macintyre - Drums.</p>
