        <h1>The Xenith Sound - Untitled</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Untitled" recorded by The Xenith Sound. The review was written by Richard Garnett in 2005.</p>
    <p>What a relief, The Xenith Sound appear to have finally found the "Sound" their moniker so proudly advertises. After previous forays that walked a precarious line between promising and Freebird the band, whether by intention or purely with the ravages of time, have found a place to call home that keeps them in the modern era.<br><br>Killer guitar riffs and mastery of effects pedals are only slightly let down by some rather quiet and overly reverbed production. A real shame as these 3 songs no doubt rip people up live with their soaring and pounding melodies. It certainly sounds as if TXS have been listening to The Music recently as gone are the ponderous rock song structures and in their place a set of hi-hat smashing beats.<br><br>Opener "Let it go" is a monster replete with wipwopwip samples looping away under the guitars. While "Stand up and walk" continues on the theme taking it down a notch. Two minute assault "Do it again" is the old TXS brought up to speed in a quick lesson of "how to rock the kids of today".<br><br>Excellent stuff with only some minor EQ adjustments required.</p>
