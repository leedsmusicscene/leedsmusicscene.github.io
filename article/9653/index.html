    <p>Zandra Klievens - Vocals<br />Jordan Radcliffe - Guitar<br />Jack Haigh - Bass<br />James Burkitt - Drums<br />David Barber - Guitar<br /><br />Formed in 2006 by Jordan Radcliffe, David Barber and Jack Haigh through a mutual love of The Strokes. It wasn't until they met Terry Marns and Zandra Klievens that the ensemble was complete and the bands musical style started to develop. In the bands first few months they gained a strong local following and a reputation as being one of Halifax's most promising bands. The band felt that in order to progress they would have to go elsewhere and play to new audiences. After many gigs around the North of England, the band earned a slot at Leeds Festival 2007. This lead to support slots with acts such as Glasvegas, Wild Beasts, Forward Russia & Bombay Bicycle Club and also led to being player on Radio 1 as Steve Lamacq's 'Demo of The Week' and 'Top 60 of 2008'. At the start of 2009, drummer Terry Marns departed the band as he wanted to focus more on his career in the fashion industry. Terrys departure caused the band to be put to once side for a time. Now the band are back on track, they have 2010 to look forward to and the release of their first single 'Thieving Magpie'..</p>
