    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for Debian Blak.</p>
    <p>Debian Blak is yet another graduate of the vibrant Leeds music scene which has produced the likes ofRamadanman, kidkanevil, Submotion Orchestra and Nightmares On Wax. Debian Blak has been honing his skills as a producer since the age of 16, though his passion for music began long before this, when at the tender age of 6 he first picked up the violin and began to tap away on the piano (not with the violin, mind).<br /> <br /> Fast forward to 2011 and Debian Blak is at the forefront of a generation of emerging creative artists in the UK. We first came across him when he remixed kidkanevil's Tokyorkshire track alongsideAirhead back in 2009. Since then he has been developing his sound as a producer, both with his solo material and working with various bands and artists across the UK - most recently producing another new First Word act, East Park Reggae Collective (he is also the drummer for the band)..</p>
