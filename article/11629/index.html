    <p>MARSICANS (MAR-si-cans)<br />Upbeat indie meets dirty pop from the north of England<br /><br />File next to: Foals, Circa Waves, Gengahr<br />Influences: Classic Pop, Rock, Indie, Samba, The Beach Boys, Paul Simon's 'Graceland'<br /><br />Marsicans are an emerging indie-pop band of 21 year-olds from Leeds, England. Their infectious pop hooks, strong harmonies, quirky lyrics, Yorkshire accents, offbeat northern humour and energetic performances have earned them glowing reviews and a growing fanbase since they first formed at high school in 2011.<br /><br />Marsicans regularly sell out gigs at home, tour up and down the UK and have graced bigger stages at festivals like Reading & Leeds and Live At Leeds. Along the way they've supported the likes of Catfish & the Bottlemen, The Pigeon Detectives and Embrace.<br /><br />From the start, the band received strong support on local radio from BBC Introducing in West Yorkshire's Alan Raw. Hands, an early recording, earned them their first UK national radio play on BBC6 Music in 2012. Terrapin, from last year's Chivalry EP, had national radio play via BBC Radio 1 and their most recent single, Gone In A Second, received airplay via XFM (now Radio X) and Amazing Radio in the UK and 3FM, the equivalent of Radio 1 in the Netherlands.<br /><br />Their current release , Gone In A Second, an official UK Record Store Day single produced by Embrace's Mickey Dale, is available digitally and on limited edition orange vinyl on Love Vs Fear/Miller Records and V2 Benelux. It also features a remix by The Pigeons Detectives' Jimmi Naylor.<br /><br />Marsicans' previous recorded output includes their debut Clocktail EP (2011), double A-side single Scuba/Eight Forty (2012) and The Chivalry EP (2014, limited edition 300 CD run sold out).<br /><br />Marsicans: Live At The 360 Club, a full set recorded at a sold-out Leeds gig in early 2015, is available for a limited time as a free download from marsicans.bandcamp.com<br /><br />Marsicans are:<br />James Newbigging - lead vocals and guitar<br />Oliver Jameson - guitar and vocals<br />Rob Brander - bass, keys and vocals<br />Matthew McHale - drums and vocals.</p>
