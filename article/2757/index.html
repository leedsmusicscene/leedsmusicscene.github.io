Built on a foundation of 10 year friendships and a desire to play exciting music to packed venues, The Pigeon Detectives have taken influences from Rolling Stones, The Cure, The Stooges to name but a few to fashion a savvy sound that’s impressing folks with every show.<br />
<br />
At the start of 2006 Gideon Coe (6Music) and Steve Lamacq (Radio 1) began airing their tracks and the five-piece caught the ear of Music Week amongst others.<br />
<br />
Their debut single 'I’m Not Sorry' was the hottest vinyl record of the year so far, it sold out the morning of release, if you got a copy you can check its current worth on ebay! The buzz started with Steve Lamacq and John Kennedy (XFM) and spread through to Zane Lowe and Jo Whiley. Nick Kaiser proclaimed them to be his favourite band in NME and on Radio One. Live reviews over the last twelve months have praised their unflappable (geddit?) presence and most of all, their ‘ear for a tune’.<br />
<br />
Fresh from a huge support tour with Dirty Pretty Things, a joint headline tour with The Holloways the band packed both Carling tents at Reading and Leeds.<br />
<br />
With the band set to release their first full release single ‘I Found Out,’ mixed by Steve Harris (U2, Kaiser Chiefs) in November 2006 the band are destined to be a flyaway success - they've been tagged "the band most likely to leap to the main stage in 2007” in the NME review of Pigeons at Reading Festival 2006.</p>
