    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2010.</p>
    <p>Today (1st March) sees the release of Season's Change, the debut EP from Leeds folk songsmith Sam Airey.<br /><br />Recorded at Mook Studios, Leeds in November 2009 and produced by Whiskas (iForward, Russia!/DTTR), this five-track release sees Sam combine folk-storytelling with the exploration of lyrical themes inspired both by his upbringing in rural North Wales and his move to the city of Leeds some four years ago, where he has since remained. <br /><br />Drawing influence from contemporary and traditional folk music, along with country and Americana, Sam plays a variety of instruments on the recording, but is also joined by Jim Morrow (drums), Hannah Wilson (backing vocals/additional keys) and Kieran O'Malley (fiddle). Gaining an increasing amount of plaudits, including Steve Lamacq (Radio 2), his live performances have garnered comparisons to such notable songwriters as Nick Drake, Conor Oberst and Johnny Flynn.  <br /><br />The EP is available to buy at Â£4 from the following places:<br /><br />Online<br /><br />http://samaireymusic.bandcamp.com<br />http://hideandseekrecords.bigcartel.com<br />http://dancetotheradio.bigcartel.com/<br /><br />Shops<br /><br />Crash Records, Leeds<br />Jumbo Records, Leeds<br /><br />and shortly:<br /><br />Hyde Park Records, Leeds.</p>
