    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for March of Dimes.</p>
    <p>Jonathan Moss: Vocals, Acoustic Guitar, Harmonica.<br />Cat Firman: Piano, Organ, Synthesizers, Backing Vocals.<br />Thomas Surman: Drums, Bass, Harmonica, Backing Vocals.<br />Sean Murricane: Bass, percussion.<br />Gordon McKiernan: Electric and Acoustic Guitar,Backing Vocals.<br />Robin Moss: Electric and Acoustic Guitar, Bass, Drums, Harmonica, Backing Vocals.<br /><br />"With harmonies to die for, poignant lyrics, strong vocals and tight playing this has to be one of the most rounded and consistent albums of 2008."<br />Paul Abraham, leedsmusicpromotions<br /><br />'All the songs are of such a high standard that it's near on impossible to select a stand out track.<br />Lyrically intelligent and musically brilliant, "All intents and purposes "is a very, very likeable album indeed. Dare I say a classic of its genre?'<br />- The Music Guru<br /><br />"An excellent set of tunes, including some verging on masterpieces, with influences including some of the most outstanding musicians in the genre"<br />- Sheffieldmusic<br /><br />'The record's mournful edge is drawn from the band's experiences whilst making the record- this is encapsulated on the particularly potent 'The great illustrator' and the sublime finale 'The cracks in the floor'.<br />This is a record of great beauty and also of great subtleties - best served with gentle lighting and a bottle (or two) of red.' 4 out of 5<br />- Subba Cultcha<br /><br />"insightful [...] melody twists in and out of everything. Delightfully gentle"<br />- The Beat Surrender<br /><br />"Arguably the most noticeable quality attributable to All Intents and Purposes however, is that it's not a record imbibed with any real kind of modern-day vigour. Rather, it sounds as if it belongs steadfastly to another age inhabited by jaded experience. Movingly poignant"<br />- Sandman Magazine<br /><br />"All Intents And Purposes has a heavy country influence, but March of Dimes always take pains to sound fresh, with the inclusion of a few unexpected instruments...The majority of people will find [it an] interesting and varied listen. Worth checking out if you like your music mellow, melodic and poignant.<br />- LeedsMusicScene 3.5/5<br /><br />'On first listen it becomes apparent that a style akin to country music and folk saturates the whole listening experience. A kind of floaty wistfulness that carrys you through the songs. But once you listen again, the subtleties of the albums mood become more apparent. A very promising debut from Leeds' ever growing indie scene, let its harmonies and poignance wash over you on the next rainy day.<br />- Live Music Scene (Bristol).</p>
