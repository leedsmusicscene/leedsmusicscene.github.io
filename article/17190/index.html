    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2012.</p>
    <p>With the aim of raising valuable funds for local homeless charity Simon on the Streets this winter, Leeds based music-videographers Anthologies, and record label/promoters Hide & Seek have collaborated on an ambitious festive music project unveiled this December. <br /><br />Entitled This Christmas (with Anthologies and Hide & Seek) it brings together many of the finest musicians from the flourishing melting-pot that is the Leeds music scene, as they capably tackle the challenge of performing a "Christmas song" in their own vastly varying but equally brilliant ways. <br /><br />The project will feature unique performance videos of these songs from some of the musicians, such as Blue Roses and Grant K. Fennell, filmed by Anthologies and available to view on their site.<br /><br />Everyone who donates to the project will automatically receive a link to download the compilation which brings together recordings from 15 of the bands involved.<br /><br />Everyone who donates will also be entered into a very generous raffle.<br /><br />Compilation download tracks include<br /><br />Backyards - Bleak Midwinter <br />Hope & Social - God Rest Ye Merry Gentleman<br />Dan Beesley & The S.S.S.S.S. - Mistletoe and Wine <br />Post War Glamour Girls - The Second Stave<br />Dancing Years - Silent Night <br />Stalking Horse - Morning Christmas<br />Ellen and the Escapades - Little Saint Nick <br />Swimming Lessons - All Alone On Christmas<br />Family Scraps (MJ of Hookworms) - Ourselves <br />The Birthday Kiss - Sentimental Christmastime<br />Fossil Collective - The Power of Love <br />These Men - How Come You're Only Nice To Me At Christmas<br />Get Machine, Destroy! - Zat You, Santa Claus? <br />Witch Hunt - Little Drummer Boy<br />Honour Before Glory & Sam Airey - Wonderful Christmastime<br /><br />More tracks will be available as live recordings are captured throughout December.<br /><br />The project will culminate in a live gig at the Brudenell Social Club on Thursday 13th December. Headlined by Dan Beesley & The SSSSS, it will also feature further contributors to the project in the shape of These Men, Grant K. Fennell, and Backyards, all playing sets that are guaranteed to generate plenty of Christmas spirit. Tickets are available for just £4 via Leeds Gig Tickets.</p>
