        <h1>Instant Species - 3-Star</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "3-Star" recorded by Instant Species. The review was written by Dave Sugden in 2001.</p>
    <p>I can't believe how impressed I am with this CD.  And not only do I get to listen to some cracking songs - and I mean cracking - I get a whole album of them through the post, a ten-track album I'd pay good money for.  No wonder it sold out its first pressing within weeks, and is almost sold out again.<br><Br>Starting off with an intro along the lines of Ash's "Kung Fu", the opening track is an initial blast of what can only be described indie-punk fun.  "Under The Bed Song" has surf guitar qualities, but shows its not constrained to any boundaries, as it a pure alternative radio friendly song from Rick & co.<BR><br>Vocally, there's a very interesting roughness throughout the CD, almost as if there's a struggle with a sore throat during recording.  But it sounds good and really makes the total sound unique.<Br><br>A couple of more indie-Britpop tracks come and go, including the quirky intro of "Rocket and Laser", and I'm still impressed.  "Keep Me Alive" is slightly more up-tempo, building up gradually before kicking off into another interesting and I'll add at this point, very bouncy, sing-along dance-along track.<Br><Br>"Home Alone" is last year's single, before "Madam Damned" is a gloriously ripped off punk song.  Fast guitars and "Oi Oi Oi" put together in fine fashion.  What makes Instant Species unique is that they continue to sing in such a way, that they make the tracks more like frenetic-indie-pop than pure punk-rock - though the guitars would of course argue otherwise.<br><bR>And if you've had enough of fast guitars, jump straight to "Her Attention" and slow down even more for the folk-rock ballad that is "Understand".   Following is a sleazy blues bar number called "Plastic Box" before "Lets Do It First" closes the CD off with some weird vocal effects.<Br><br>As you can guess, I really enjoyed listening to this CD.  On an individual song-by-song basis there are other better songs out there in Leeds.  However, to say that this CD has ten, count 'em TEN, quality tracks on and I cannot fault any is impressive.</p>
