        <h1>The Soul Circle Gang - Fresh Fruit / Umbrella of Life</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Fresh Fruit / Umbrella of Life" recorded by The Soul Circle Gang. The review was written by Gerard Leachman in 2013.</p>
    <p>This EP is comprised of two tracks, 'Fresh Fruit' and 'Umbrella of Life'. For those of you who don't know Soul Circle Gang mix soul, reggae to create a project that is mind blowing. That is them live. This being their first EP I was hoping that it would be able to capture their explosive live sound. Sadly this wasn't completely the case. <br /><br />'Fresh Fruit' represents the reggae side of The Soul Circle Gang. Disappointingly this track was drab and felt like it really wasn't going anywhere. The three and a half minutes seemed to last way too long. It didn't translate well from the live setting.<br /><br />Second track 'Umbrella of Life' was in the complete opposite direction. It's perfect of balance of funk and soul and is a much better representation of this band. The five and a half minutes passed by in what felt like seconds. <br /><br />Hopefully music released by this group in the future will continue to be as interesting and diverse as 'Umbrella of Life' is.<br /><br /><iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2638610322/size=medium/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="http://thesoulcirclegang.bandcamp.com/album/fresh-fruit-umbrella-of-life">Fresh Fruit / Umbrella of Life by The Soul Circle Gang</a></iframe></p>
