    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Hard To Let You Go" recorded by Spitfire Charlie. The review was written by Richard Garnett in 2007.</p>
    <p>The biog accompanying  this release talks of “plans for the summer” but at the last report 3 out of 4 of Spitfire Charlie were heading for pastures new. That may be all lies or the whole truth but with nothing to substantiate it this review will plough on as if none the wiser. If however this is the death knell for a band that have roamed the Leeds scene with innumerable releases for the past 4 or so years, it is not a fitting one. “Hard To Let You Go” probably ramps it up live but on record, at 4 minutes plus it feels bloated and lacking a strong enough direction to make it a single. There’s energy, melody, guitar inventiveness but something never sits right. For a band who have previously delivered time and again it’s a little disappointing. John Roberts proud vocal style seems to sit above the song rather than meld perfectly within. B-side “Start Our Own Religion” comes off little better. It’s more post-Libs high hat sparring stuff but again fails to land the final punch. Hopefully all these rumours are far from the mark and the men of SC will return to prove us wrong once again.</p>
