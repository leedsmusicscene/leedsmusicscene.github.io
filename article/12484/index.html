        <h1>Local musicians needed for Leeds Arena campaign</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2010.</p>
    <p>Local unsigned musicians are being invited to provide a soundtrack to an upcoming animation of the Leeds Arena.<br /><br />The Leeds Arena project is currently in the process of creating a three minute fly-through animation of the venue, which will show the unique arena in action and will include previously unreleased material of the arena in high quality 3D.<br /><br />The animation requires a soundtrack, and in celebration of Leeds' vibrant music scene, the council is offering the opportunity for local musicians to have their music as the backing track to this exciting animation.<br /><br />The video will be hosted on the Leeds Arena homepage and will be used in presentations across the city, the region and the nation. The animation will be one of the central marketing materials for the project. The chosen track and artist will be fully credited and promoted within the video.<br /><br />The successful artiste will have the opportunity to meet with the world class arena design team and get an exclusive behind the scenes look at the emerging arena design. All genres of music are welcomed and the deadline for entries is March 15th (next Monday).<br /><br />Councillor Andrew Carter, council leader and executive member with responsibility for the Leeds Arena said:<br /><br />"The arena will help raise Leeds' profile worldwide and it is only right that local musicians benefit from exposure of the arena project. The animation that is being developed will really bring the project to life and is also a great opportunity for local musicians to promote their music and to reach wider audiences. We are very keen to encourage the growing music scene in the city and look forward to receiving entries from lots of local artists."<br /><br />Interested musicians are asked to send their compositions of at least three minutes long on a CD along with their contact details, to:<br /><br />Leeds Arena Soundtrack<br />Major Projects<br />Thoresby House<br />Leonardo Building<br />Leeds<br />LS2 8HD<br /><br />Alternatively, artists can e-mail leedsarenaproject [ at ] leeds.gov.uk with a link to a piece of music for consideration.</p>
