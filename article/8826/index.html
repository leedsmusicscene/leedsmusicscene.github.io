    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for Daniel Pearson.</p>
    <p>Daniel Pearson trades in timeless and melodic songs that fuse the dynamics of alternative rock to the heart-on sleeve honesty of classic singer-songwriters, sung with a unique voice that's equal parts confidence and vulnerability. He has been hailed as "Britain's best new singer-songwriter" (AllGigs) and "a genuine talent you'd follow throught thick and thin" (Shout 4 Music) and his debut album SATELLITES has been praised by Uncut Magazine, Drowned In Sound, Americana UK, Leeds Music Scene, Whisperin' and Hollerin' and R2 Magazine. <br /><br />Growing up he fell in love with the US alt. rock typified by The Lemonheads, Nirvana and Elliott Smith, and his songs also channel a longtime love of The National, Bruce Springsteen and Ryan Adams. After early years spent gigging and recording in indie and punk bands Pearson relocated to Leeds and honed his solo sound in the live venues of the city, supporting a diverse range of acts like Wild Beasts, Rooney, The Rifles, One Night Only, Chris Helme and Danny & The Champions of The World in the process. His acoustic-driven indie-rock became Daniel's trademark sound, and as word spread about a distinctive artist crafting infectious melodies and bruised ballads he gained airplay on XFM and BBC 6Music and picked up a raft of positive coverage in local press.<br /><br />SATELLITES showcases a talented songwriter and lyricist standing apart in crowded field. Recorded for the most part at The Soundmill in Leeds over a lively 5 day period in the summer, the album was co-produced by Pearson and the talented Ed Heaton. Additional mixing and mastering of two songs was done by local punk hero Tom Woodhead (formerly of !Forward Russia!) using Pearson's home recordings. While many singer-songwriters stick to the narrow confines of bedsit acoustics, SATELLITES contains an impressive range of well crafted songs that sound immediately familiar. The tender fragility of album opener Masquerade and the sweeping, heartfelt Waves In The Sea contrast to the effervescent pop bounce of Tracks and the anthemic melodies of Wishing Well. Also present is the Stonesy stomp of Black n' Blue, a two and a half minute blast of countrified powerpop in 4th July and the haunting, satirical swipe at celebrity culture Civilians..</p>
