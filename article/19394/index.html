    <p>Organisers of the Leeds Festival 2016 have this week confirmed their second headliners, following their first announcement confirming Red Hot Chili Peppers' return to Leeds.<br /><br />Foals and Disclosure have been named as co-headliners for this year's festival, which takes place at Bramham Park in Leeds across the August Bank Holiday Weekend.<br /><br />Melvin Benn commented: "I couldn't be more excited about this announcement. A co-headline with two of the most promising British acts out there; Foals secret set last year was a highlight for me, as I'm sure their debut headline slot will be, coupled with the phenomenal Disclosure - we're very proud to be able to give these acts the recognition they deserve."<br /><br />In a European Festival Exclusive, Imagine Dragons will also be returning to Leeds Festival. Also joining the line up for UK Festival Exclusives are Two Door Cinema Club, Fetty Wap, The Internet and Parkway Drive.<br /><br />The full list of new additions is: <br /><br />Foals / Disclosure / Jack Ü / Imagine Dragons / Two Door Cinema Club / Fetty Wap / Crystal Castles / Parkway Drive / Nothing But Thieves / The Internet / Oliver Heldens / Hannah Wants / Kurupt FM Presents: Champagne Steam Rooms / CassetteBoy vs DJ Rubbish<br /><br />Weekend tickets are £205 and you can also pay via the instalment plan - tickets for Leeds Festival 2016 can be purchased now.</p>
