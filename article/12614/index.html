    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2010.</p>
    <p>It's that time of the year again as tomorrow (Monday, 29th March) sees the official launch for Leeds 2010. And not only does the line up get announced on Monday evening, but tickets will also go on sale tomorrow at 6.45pm.<br /><br />Leeds 2010 takes place at Bramham Park over the August Bank Holiday weekend, 27th - 29th August. Ticket prices are £180 for the full weekend, including camping, or £75 for a day ticket. An Early Bird ticket this year will set you back £15. <br /><br />Tickets usually sell out quite quickly, so it is best to be prepared for the sale. It can be quite frustrating, especially if it is your first year, so our recommendation is to get those laptops and web links ready - or mobile if you're buying over the phone.<br /><br />Your best bet for online buying is to try from Ticketmaster or from See Tickets. Bookmark the links now so you're ready for tomorrow.<br /><br />You can also buy from Leeds stores Crash Records, Jumbo Records or from HMV Leeds Headrow. The HMV store will open from 7am on Tuesday morning and you can also buy in person from the Leeds Visitor Centre in the station from 9am on Tuesday morning.<br /><br />A full set of official Leeds 2010 ticket links can be found on our Leeds Festival mini-site.<br /><br />The official line up for Leeds 2010 is also announced tomorrow with Guns N Roses, Blink 182, Arcade Fire and The Libertines the hot rumours at the moment to take the prestigious Main Stage headline slots. Hole and Paramore are also rumoured to make an appearance.<br /><br />We'll be posting the line up tomorrow evening as it is announced, so keep checking Leeds Music Scene for the latest Leeds festival line up news.</p>
