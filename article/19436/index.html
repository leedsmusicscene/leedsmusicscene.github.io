    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for Meihaus.</p>
    <p>Meihaus create memorable and often intense alt pop/rock music from their studio in a converted mill in Bradford, England. <br /> <br />Formed in early 2014, Meihaus began life as the songwriting venture of Luke Womersley and John Driscoll. They were soon joined by Greg Jones, Luke Haran and Jonny Miller, who added depth to what was already a very promising project. The band have been likened to influences such as; Fleetwood Mac, Tame Impala, Radiohead and Jeff Buckley. <br /> <br />Now an established live act, having played at many respected venues in the North of England, Meihaus look to the future with optimism and excitement, with new releases due in early 2016.<br /><br />"Bradford five-piece fronted by Luke Womersley, who joyfully rotated between cowbell, tambourine, keys and maracas and whose poise gave the impression of having the crowd in the palm of his hand. Supported by sublime guitar work, the band's elements merged into truly unique hooks". - THE GRYPHON<br /><br />"The night started in excellent fashion with the surprisingly fantastic Meihaus from Bradford, bringing very soulful, indie-pop with very catchy hooks played by a really tight and well rehearsed band with a strong lead vocal, making these guys very much worth looking out for in the future". - THE AJSFAD.</p>
