        <h1>Harmacy - Untitled</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Untitled" recorded by Harmacy. The review was written by Chris Woolford in 2005.</p>
    <p>Bradford slacker rock outfit Harmacy are a bit of a find. I’ve never heard of them before but if they’re gigging locally I’d recommend checking them out.<br><br>It’s laidback blues-rock with nasty guitars (in the good way) and a “screw you” attitude. On the local band scene imagine a cross between Unclejohnny and The Pigeon Detectives. On a bigger stage they almost certainly draw their sound from the Kings of Leon and The Lemonheads, with maybe a slight dash of Pavement for good measure.<br><bR>Opener ‘Black Comedy’ is a droning yet catchy pop tune that hammers its way into your head before its guitars jet-off into a screeching solo that will make the hairs on your neck stand on end. The following tracks ‘Walk the Walk’ and ‘100 Years’ are both similar in vein and, while being pretty good tunes, don’t quite manage to reach the same heights as the lead track. However as a three track demo it’s pretty hard to fault.<br><bR>Harmacy fit the slacker-rock sound to a tee and, while not being particularly innovative, are certainly at the top of their game in this genre. I’m pretty sure that this fairly unknown local band could compete on a bigger stage with their Yank counterparts. I just wish I’d heard of them earlier.</p>
