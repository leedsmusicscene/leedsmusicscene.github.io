    <p>Cloth Cat Studios Ltd is embarking on the largest survey possibly ever of bands and musicians in the Leeds area. With recent funding secured through the Oxygen Fund, the aim is to identify the needs of the local scene to best promote their music.<br><br>Unlike the general music industry which largely comes from a commercial perspective, Cloth Cat is a community based organisation which looks to promote and develop people through music and creativity.<br><br>Mike Jolly, Development Worker said: "Through this survey, we will be looking at opening up all sorts of possibilities which will help bands to progress whether it's setting up a recording studio, developing a record label or running seminars on the music industry. The best way to find out what people want is to ask them!"<br><br>Cloth Cat aims to provide the resources and opportunities within music so that people are able to gain the skills and experience to be employed doing the things in life that are important to them. Once all the information from the questionnaires has been analysed, the project will look for funding to make the relevant services available.  The idea will be to house these facilities in a centre all under one roof where people can come to interact with each other and take their own projects further.<br><br>Returned forms will be entered in to a prize draw with the chance of winning some band gear donated by local music stores Rockshack and Academy of Sound.<br><br>Questionnaires can be found in most music shops and venues around the centre of Leeds, but can also be obtained by contacting Mike Jolly at Cloth Cat Studios on 0113-244-2773 or by e-mail at clothcatleeds@yahoo.co.uk.</p>
