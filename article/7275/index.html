    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for Heads We Dance.</p>
    <p>In little less than a year, Bex (lead vocals/drums), Pete (vocals/synths) and Yoni (synths/vocals) have collaborated with Little Boots, been the most blogged about band in the world for a week long period according to the Hype Machine Chart and been remixed by the likes of Don Diablo, Frankmusik and Russ Chimes.  Their debut album, Love Technology, included two tracks featured as Popjustice 'Song of the Day', was described by Artrocker magazine as "glittering, lustrous electro pop" and elsewhere as "everything La Roux wants to be and more" (Leeds Guide, June 2008).<br /><br />On 14 December HEADS WE DANCE follow up the blog hype and critical acclaim for Love Technology with a double A-side of exciting new material on label of the moment Gash Digital.  The highly anticipated double A-side, 'Take My Picture' / 'After Dark', showcases a band confidently playing to their strengths.<br /><br />'Take My Picture' is a sleazy electro-pop stomp which flawlessly combines HEADS WE DANCE's dancefloor roots with an irresistibly catchy modern pop chorus.  Meanwhile, 'After Dark' sets a claustrophobic mean streets drama to driving warehouse beats.  Both tracks have been remixed by some of the hottest up-and-coming dance artists including B-Xentric, Justin Faust and The Amplid.<br /><br />Perfectly demonstrating HEADS WE DANCE's eclectic electro-pop sound and infectious melodic skills, 'Take My Picture' / 'After Dark' proves that HEADS WE DANCE are "the act this country needs to give the elite some competition" (iDJ Magazine, February 2009)..</p>
