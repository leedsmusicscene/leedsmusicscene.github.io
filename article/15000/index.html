    <p>Leeds band Resonance are about to release their debut single 'SUNSET BLVD' with b-side 'GOTTA BE', after playing together as a 5 piece for nearly a year. <br /><br />The single was recorded and mixed by Whiskas (Forward Russia) and mastered by Bruce Wood of Touchwood Studios (The Cribs) and is set for release on July 25th.<br /><br />The band are currently building a solid fanbase, having recently played shows at The Cockpit, 360 Club @ The Library, The Well and other main venues to ecstatic crowds.<br /><br />Describing their sound, the band said "Our music varies from heavy guitar-driven blues-rock, to a more alternative and progressive rock sound and we aim to create a style from the many influences that we have." <br /><br />Speaking about the forthcoming single, Jonny Von Grun from the band says "Sunset is about being determined to get that one thing right, with help from places that you never expected and being able to sit back, relax and watch it take off in front of you." <br /><br />Resonance will be launching their single at the 360 Club at The Library on Friday 15th July, about which they further commented:<br /><br />"360 Club has a big reputation for being a top class live show and we know it's gonna be a great night on July 15th. We're especially excited that the gig is being recorded and filmed for BBC Introducing and the big screens in the north. Alan Raw will be down checking us out and interviewing us, it's a big gig and opportunity for us."<br /><br />The band are also booked in for an interview for local Bradford radio station BCB (106.6FM) on Wednesday July 20th.</p>
