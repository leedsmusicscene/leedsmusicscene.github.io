    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2015.</p>
    <p>360 Club has teamed up with Musicians Union to host a free music industry event on 13th January 2015 at The Library in Leeds. <br /><br />The event is a "must attend" event for bands, artists, musicians, managers, and those looking to work in the music industry, and will look at band agreements and artist management, followed by a music business panel where you can ask all manner of questions. <br /> <br />Richard Watson, promoter of 360 Club, told us "The idea and ethos of the Club has always and will always be the same, giving new exciting emerging acts the opportunity to play live, and behind the scenes offering them all help, advice and support across many areas of the music industry.  <br /> <br />360 Club has produced bands such Alt-J, Allusondrugs, Carnabells and Forever Cult. This names only a few of the bands that have prospered from playing the venue and the advice and help they've received."<br /> <br />This event is free courtesy of Musicians' Union (MU) and has been put on in association with 360 Club, the MMF (Music Manager's Forum), Northrop McNaughtan Deller (NMD), and Blacks Solicitors.  You can register for free at Eventbrite.</p>
