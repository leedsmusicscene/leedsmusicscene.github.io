        <h1>These Monsters - Call Me Dragon</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Call Me Dragon" recorded by These Monsters. The review was written by Chris Audsley in 2010.</p>
    <p>Local experimental rock band, These Monsters, have been around for three years and have finally unleashed their debut album, 'Call Me Dragon', to the baying public. The band's patience seems to have paid dividends as they have delivered an album full of creativity and energy.<br /><br />Opening the album is the title track. The thick repetitive riff on the intro is very powerful. The main theme follows as the song builds and builds to a massive crescendo. The traditional mix of guitar, bass and drums with the addition of a wild saxophone means that they are able to cross a number of genres where metal, rock, jazz and prog-rock are all evident throughout.<br /><br />'Who Is This Tall Sick Man?' is another powerful hard-rock instrumental track, while 'Biggie And Tupac' is a crazy tribute to the murdered Gangsta Rap duo. It goes straight into 'Harry Patton,' which has an atmospheric introduction that has the feel of an old cop film jazz score. The two work really well together, with the latter being the highlight of the album.<br /><br />With 'Space Ritual' the song's introduction has a slightly out of tune synth effect that then runs through the first part of the song. The song is more relaxed and calmer than earlier ones in the album, which is a refreshing change. While the song does have its moments of frantic rhythms it's still a more composed affair.  The album finishes off nicely with 'Deaf Machine,' which is similar to the structured aggregation and chaos of the opening tracks.<br /><br />Throughout the album, These Monsters display good use of light and shade. The driving rhythm section is key to the band as it allows the lead guitar and saxophone to sit nicely on top. Everything has a meaning in each song and there are so many twists and turns.  It's not just big, big solos like many prog-rock instrumentals of the 70's where there may be a tendency for one to switch off halfway; this stuff is very exciting and you'll listen to this to the very end, again and again.</p>
