    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for Little Vegas Lies.</p>
    <p>West Yorkshire 5 piece, Little Vegas Lies are a band with influences from a strong heritage of British Rock bands. Inspired by the likes of the Beatles, The Who, Led Zeppellin, The Stone Roses, Oasis and The Manic Street Preachers, the band are now ready to showcase their own brand of Brit-rock. Live4ever e-zine recently said, "Little Vegas Lies, right off the bat, sound assured of themselves, unafraid of harnessing some obvious influences to forge a sound genuinely quite unique."<br /><br />The band formed mid 2010 after a conversation between Simon Moore and Steve McNamara about the current state of the music industry. This resulted with the conclusion that music has 'lost its soul'. Within a year of formation, the band self funded the release of their debut EP 'A Truth Not Far Away' produced by renowned producer Grant Henderson. The bands continuous hard work and DIY ethic paid off as they received an invitation from BBC Introducing to perform a live session with Alan Raw on BBC Leeds which has helped raise the bands profile. <br /><br />Little Vegas Lies aim to end the year on a high as they plan to release their second EP. A new look, a new sound and a new line up reinforce the bands continued message against the current music trend which is dominated by urban, R&B and dance music..</p>
