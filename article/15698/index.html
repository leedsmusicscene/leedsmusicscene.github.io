    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2011.</p>
    <p>Leeds Festival organisers have continued the fight against ticket touts with another step forward at Leeds 2011, extending the successes in 2010.<br /><br />Code named "Operation Beryllium" this is the second year that the operation, which is financed by Festival Republic, has run and once again it proved a huge success in disrupting the activities of ticket touts. <br /><br />Officers from a number of different agencies formed a "multi agency tout response vehicle" that toured the roads around the festival site at Bramham Park during the event. <br /><br />The minibus is provided by Leeds Festival, with officers and evidence gathering staff from West Yorkshire Police, Leeds City Council Highways Enforcement, West Yorkshire Trading Standards and Leeds Festival ticketing staff using it to tour the roads around the festival site. <br /><br />They stopped and interviewed all touts and were able to issue two cease trading orders to individuals who refused to leave when requested.  <br /><br />Melvin Benn, Managing Director of Festival Republic, said: "I am delighted that agencies once again were able to join together in such a united and organised manner and that we were able to disrupt the touts' activities. We hope very much to repeat the response vehicle again in the future and are very grateful to all the agencies involved for their co-operation".<br /><br />Tickets for Leeds Festival 2012 will go on sale on December 2nd. Music fans should ensure they only buy from official Leeds ticket agencies, such as Ticketmaster and See Tickets.</p>
