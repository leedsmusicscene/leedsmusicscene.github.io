    <p>To coincide with Leeds celebrating its 800th birthday this year, Leeds City Council and promoters Futuresound have put together a ground-breaking city-wide, three-day music festival over the second May Bank Holiday weekend (25th, 26th and 27th May) with hopes that the event will become an annual event on the music scene's calendar.<br><br>The Live At Leeds weekend will feature one main day (Saturday 26th May) that will revolve around all-day events at the Cockpit, Faversham, Brudenell Social Club, Joseph's Well, and Mixing Tin, with more venues expected to join in as plans are revealed further. Well-known acts, or 'headliners', will be scattered throughout the day and night to offer an exciting schedule and to avoid much of the disappointment of time clashes as the night progress.<br><br>There will be a single ticket (wristband) for all five all-day events, with people free to move around from venue to venue sampling as much of the gig activity as they want – think of it running in a manner similar to the Camden Crawl in London.<br><br>If you're interested in buying a wristband then visit Crash Records or Jumbo Records. A wristband costs just £10 and will allow the wearer to move between the venues.<br><br>For your £10 wristband you could watch: New Vinyl, Otherside, Voltage Union, Duels, Black Wire, The Voltz, Stations,  Cry For Silence, Drop Dead Gorgeous, Send More Paramedics, From Autumn To Ashes, Breaking The Illusion, Middleman, Stateless, Heads We Dance, The Isles, Slow Club, Tiny Dancers, Rochelle, The Hair, Harrisons, The Blueskins, Vessels, Winnebago Deal, Shut Your Eyes And You'll Burst Into Flames, Wintermute, The Rosie Taylor Project, The Teenagers, The Ripps, Wild Beasts, The Lodger, Zoot Woman, The Relience, Ben Greaves, The Assembly, Highflyer, The Turn, Snipereyes, Black Bikini Special, Sketches In Technicolour, Tiger That Talked, The Invention and Frankie Eisenhower. Phew!<br><br>On top of these all-day shows, there will be several ticketed events around the city, running as part of the Live At Leeds celebrations. These gig include Stephen Fretwell (tickets), Kate Nash (tickets), Biffy Clyro (tickets), The Pigeon Detectives (tickets) and the Slam Dunk Festival (tickets). Note that these events are ticketed separately, and a wristband does not provide for entry.<br><br>Additional events on the Friday and Sunday are expected to be announced, in time.<br><br>And finally, if that wasn't mouthwatering enough, the city will be host to several seminars and there will be music industry education for young people and aspiring local bands. In fact, you could consider Live At Leeds to be akin to a SXSW Leeds!<br><br>For the full line up, check the Leeds Gig Guide.</p>
