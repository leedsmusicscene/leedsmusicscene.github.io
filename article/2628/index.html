        <h1>Kram - Come The Demarcation</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Come The Demarcation" recorded by Kram. The review was written by Simon Glacken in 2004.</p>
    <p>Kram's previous efforts were not well received by Leeds Music Scene. One and half stars and a general roasting from reviewer Richard Garnett. Well it's been a year but the question is whether they have continued the trend or come back with a belter of an EP as a fingers up to Mr Garnett.<bR><br>Well actually it's neither. First off though, for a band with a manager and a fancy website you'd think they'd be able to get in a decent producer. Sounding like it was recorded on a 4 track the songs sound messy and unclear and the fact that you can hear the click at the end of "Epitath" is shocking. This immediately puts the band at a disadvantage.<br><br>However bad production aside the songs themselves are good enough to shine through. With vocals like those of a tamer Matt Bellamy but with the pronunciation skills of Johnny Rotten they add force to the songs and give them that extra push.<br><br>The riffs at times are a little generic but still catchy enough to encourage repeat listens. A blend of clever rock coupled with dumb metal to produce moments in each song that make you look up and pay attention. This is evident in opening track "Emmulation",  the highlight of the 3 track EP.<Br><br>It's a shame as this could have been so much better if it wasn't for the terrible production which takes a lot away from the songs.</p>
