        <h1>Medusa</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for Medusa.</p>
    <p>You know that feeling when your aeroplane seat jolts beneath you, rattling the ice in your third beer and you notice the aircrew in collusion that something is very wrong.<br /><br />Upon refocusing, you realise the letters in your alphabet soup spell out meet me in the restroom and you look up to be signalled a confident wink from the minxy air hostess who gave it to you...<br /><br />A few moments later, as she slips through the door joining you inside the bathroom, she slowly and smoothly reaches down her chest withdrawing a hand grenade, then pulls out the pin with her teeth...<br /><br />Now you're in a fix. Medusa won't lie to you.<br /><br />If it's reassurance or validation you're after, you're in the wrong place. You're on yr own.<br /><br />After recording the raucous, 80's inspired Self Titled debut album in late 2006, a matter of weeks after forming, singer/guitarist Julian Molinero's band of rock 'n' roll lunatics took to the streets of the UK for a long and constant stream of live dates across the country's music halls, spanning two years.<br /><br />During this time Julian began piecing together ideas for the lengthier second album Can't Fucking Win. Medusa hit the studio to begin recording in late February 2009, with a new refined sound and 360 degree sonic scope, while still maintaining the same vitriolic power and purring melodies.<br /><br />Medusa is the new rock 'n' roll group the 21st century has been aching for, a voice from within inciting truth and liberation. It's about power, it's about passion, it's about fXXXing time..</p>
