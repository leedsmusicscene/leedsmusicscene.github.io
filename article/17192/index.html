    <p>Destroy All Records, Leeds' newest independent record label, have just announced Mahogany Hand Glider as their first signing. As a welcome gift they are offering their debut EP for FREE through Bandcamp (mahoganyhandglider.bandcamp.com).<br /><br />"Naked Huf" is the debut EP from Leeds based experimental math-rockers Mahogany Hand Glider. After releasing their two previous singles "Orcas/ i" & "Godnose" this EP sees their sonic texture grow and thicken out with the addition of keys and sax, taking influence from the artists as diverse as Battles, Omar Rodriguez-Lopez  and Flying Lotus. Consisting of Harry Springall (guitar), Sean Goodchild (guitar), Alec Hewes (bass), Dan Chappell (drums) and Geordan Reid-Campbell (keys/ samples). The band have played alongside the likes of Maybeshewill, You Slut! and renowned Japanese math-rockers Lite. <br /><br />"Naked Huf" is an uplifting journey through solid grooves, other-worldly sounds, highly expressive guitar rhythms and soaring melodies. A perfect dynamic balance between chilled out moments juxtaposed with just the right amount of aggression in places. Second track 'Fringe' provides enough bite with what is arguably their most playful yet menacing track. The EP comes accompanied with a live music video for the final track 'This Isn't Funny Anymore', a collage of footage gathered from two separate performances, directed and edited by good friend and artist Jonathan Duffin. <br /><br />The band plan to record a follow up EP in January for their first official release through Destroy All Records in time for summer 2013. <br /><br />Upcoming Live dates...<br /><br />12th Dec 2012 - Brudenell Social Club, Leeds - w/ Roller Trio (2012 Mercury Prize Nominees)<br />24th Jan 2013 - Hukaz, Leeds - w/ Engines (Free Gig)<br />1st-2rd March 2013 - British Wildlife Festival, Leeds - w/ That Fucking Tank, You Slut!, Shield Your Eyes, Blacklisters, Godzilla Black<br /><br />Find the band here:<br />facebook.com/mahoganyhandglider<br />@MahoganyBand<br />http://mahoganyhandglider.bandcamp.com/releases<br /><br /><br />Destroy All Records:<br />facebook.com/destroyallrecords<br />@DstryRcrds</p>
