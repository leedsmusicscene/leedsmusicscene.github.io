    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for Spacehog.</p>
    <p>In 1994, SPACEHOG, with original band members, the Langdon brothers - Royston and Antony, Jonny Cragg (also played in Flowers For Agatha, The Hollow Men, Arckid, The Twenty Twos) & Richard Steel became quickly infamous for their legendary East Village gigs. Their sound was so very different from the neo-grunge movement of the early 90's, that within a short time, they signed a cocktail napkin deal with the famed record exec, Seymour Stein and the Sire label.<br /><br />On October 24, 1995, Spacehog released their debut album, Resident Alien, produced by Bryce Goggin. Resident Alien was widely received, reaching #1 on Billboard's Heatseeker's chart, selling over a million copies, and spawning the hit single and video, the #1 mainstream rock hit, "In the Meantime". Spacehog created their own genre of sound, challenging the moniker of glam-rock and creating a new identity, carrying forth the profound influences of T Rex, Iggy Pop, Queen, David Bowie & the Spiders, by colliding these legendary sounds with a wall of distorted guitars and the stupendous daring of Royston Langdon's lead vocals. It was a musical statement that seemed to say, life is too serious to be taken seriously, and was a welcome reprise from the levity of late-90's alt-rock.<br /><br />The band's second album, The Chinese Album, was released in March 1998. Spacehog signed with Danny Goldberg's musically discriminating independent label, Artemis Records, and released its third album, The Hogyssey produced by Paul Ebersol, in Memphis Tennessee in February 2001.<br /><br />Spacehog set off on their own personal journeys of growth; the inevitable musical voyage has reignited for the band, which now brings their individual experiences and sounds to the reinvigorated Spacehog.<br /><br />Recently, Timo Ellis joined the band on guitar as Antony Langdon continues his cinematic pursuits. In 2013, Spacehog created a new collection of tunes, As It Is On Earth, once again produced by Bryce Goggin..</p>
