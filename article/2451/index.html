        <h1>Spitfire Charlie - Untitled</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Untitled" recorded by Spitfire Charlie. The review was written by Sam Saunders in 2004.</p>
    <p>A clumsy first intro and a lightly thin vocal sound from Singer John Roberts gave me a first impression that Spitfire Charlie were just another emo-esque double garage band from Adel. "How I Learnt To Love The Bomb" isn't  a great title and the song doesn’t do the band justice as an opener.<br><br>BUT<Br><br>With four more tracks in the locker, Spitfire Charlie start splattering the bullets around and anyone who isn’t looking up had better take cover. "Playing Hard" has a really original guitar lick and on its own it persuades me to pay much closer attention. A guitarist who can imagine - and then play - a cute and difficult line without the listener having to grimace in time is a rare joy. John Rennie can play a bit. Ben Kreczak on bass and Dan Handysides on drums are no slackers neither.<bR><br>"Old Friend" has a nice open ring to it, with a U2-kind of feel with restrained passion and inventive guitar and a Chris Martin kind of melody. Not the sweet Martin voice of course (a blessing?).  It’s a bit more wannabe emo forced-larynx pressure that lowers the volume and raises the pitch. Suits some.<br><br>"She who must be obeyed" has a curious drag in the early tempo, and I'm not sure my CD players are doing the song justice. It’s a pretty desperate song and drags a bit. Better on second and third hearings.<br><Br>"Where's All The Money Gone" is much punchier and rockier. It’s sharp and repetitive in a very good way, and some vocal harmony ups the song delivery system to special courier status. There's plenty more kick donkey drumming. And Hallelujah! A rock freakout guitar section that really works. The best I've heard for bloody ages. Watch your back.</p>
