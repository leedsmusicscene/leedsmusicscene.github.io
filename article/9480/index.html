    <p>‘Life Is Sweet’, the second album from Leeds band The Lodger, will be released on 19th May on local label Bad Sneakers Records. The first single to be released from the album is ‘The Good Old Days’, out 5th May on limited-edition 7” vinyl and Digital Download formats.<br><br>Brimming with insistently catchy hooks and sing-along choruses The Lodger bring a classic pop sensibility to their sometimes tender, sometimes bitter take on the ups and downs of life and love.  Critics have pointed to The Lodger’s place in a musical tradition including The Smiths, The Housemartins and Belle & Sebastian, and The Lodger share a similar emphasis on the skills of classic song writing and a uniquely British take on classic guitar pop.<br><br>Their latest release follows previous singles on Dance To The Radio, and a single and debut album on Angular Records, and follows their recent tour support to the Long Blondes.<br><br>You can watch the video to ‘The Good Old Days’ at You Tube.<br><br>Catch The Lodger live in Leeds when they play an acoustic in-store show at Jumbo Records on 19th May.</p>
