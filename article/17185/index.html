        <h1>Debut album from Harry George Johns released in February</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2012.</p>
    <p>Harry George Johns has this week confirmed that his mini album 'Post Breakdown Blues' is set for a release on 11th February 2013.<br /><br />After touring and recording as a part of bands Dinosaur Pile Up and Old Romantic Killer Band, Leeds based musician Harry George Johns now goes solo with his new mini album 'Post Breakdown Blues'. <br /><br />The mini album is an incredibly personal diary of a dark and desperate time. As Winter 2011 was in full flow, Harry found himself confronting issues such as mental illness, heartbreak and homelessness.  He stayed on a mate's floor with a laptop and a few microphones and, inspired by this dark time, Harry wrote and recorded 'Post Breakdown Blues'.<br /><br />Previously known for his raucous on and off stage antics, touring all over the world with bands like Supergrass, Therapy? and Von Bondies, as well as playing at Leeds and Reading festival in the UK and SXSW in Texas, Harry's new material sees him produce his most honest work to date. With these new songs, Harry has drawn upon influences like the bluesy big voices of Taj Mahal, Joe Cocker, Son House and Robert Plant combined with the tenderness of Ryan Adams and John Martyn.<br /><br />The track listing for 'Post Breakdown Blues' is:<br /><br />1. Tie Your Own Noose<br />2. All You Can Do<br />3. Drink Myself To Sleep<br />4. Sleep Is The Cousin of Death<br />5. Morning Song<br />6. Hospital Blues<br /><br />You can stream and download 'Hospital Blues' below:<br /><br /><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F69077280&show_artwork=true"></iframe></p>
