    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for Milloy.</p>
    <p>Jim McManus - Vocals.<br>Michael Beevers - Guitar.<br>Ian Smart - Bass.<br>Rob Bedford - Guitar.<br>Andrew Briggs - Drums.<br><br>Formed in the summer of 1999, Wakefield’s Milloy soon established themselves as a loud, impassioned punk rock band with songs that burn with a melodic ferocity rarely heard this side of the Atlantic.<br><br>But for many, that simplistic description just isn’t enough. Amidst the swirling morass of duelling guitars, lock tight bass and drums and gruff, impassioned vocals, something else has to be going on. But there isn’t. Milloy are quite simply a punk band who want to rock, and rock they do!<br><br>After releasing an EP on Leeds’ Crackle Records in 2000, it proved to be a record that amazed many, earning them stellar reviews and even BBC Radio1 airplay by the late, great John Peel.<br><br>For many, Milloy left others no choice but to watch as they took their blistering live show to the people, releasing a further 2 EPs – ‘Belt up’ and a split EP with Manchester’s The Leif Ericsson, both adored by punk fanzines and major music magazines alike. This paved the way for a debut album release and a short tour through America in 2005 that would seal Milloy in the minds of many as a truly great band.<br><br>To all that naysay, Milloy have repeatedly broken the mould of typical punk/melodic hardcore pigeonholing with their distinctly British sound and have graced the stage with such bands as - Against Me!, Snuff, Leatherface, Hell Is For Heroes, Hot Water Music, The Draft, Hundred Reasons, GBH, Subhumans, The Futureheads, The Explosion, The Lawrence Arms, Sainte Catherines, Get Cape Wear Cape Fly and Billy No Mates to name but a few! And the hits just keep on coming. With the follow up to 2005’s ‘More Than A Machine’ in the pipeline, a pending UK tour, AND the pending release of a split EP with Billy No Mates (ex Snuff) things have never been better. Let’s get it on!.</p>
