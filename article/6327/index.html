        <h1>Spitfire Charlie - No Need To Fight</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "No Need To Fight" recorded by Spitfire Charlie. The review was written by Richard Garnett in 2006.</p>
    <p>While others have come and gone, Spitfire Charlie have inauspiciously established themselves as a recognisable fixture on the Leeds scene. The former students' numerous demo releases have charted a band learning their craft and now with a spin from Steve Lamacq under their belts, all the signs point to a recipe that is starting to taste just right. Gone are the more blues led influences, replaced by spiky hi-hat work and choppy guitars. “No Need to Fight” sounds like a Mod-Coral and though it lacks a real pay-attention chorus, it drives along splendidly with some great guitar and bass work. John Roberts’ excellent gravely vocals are now more fitting and the Led-Zep comparisons of the past seem like a distant memory. “Let’s See What It Will Bring” is more of the same with stuttering, spluttering drums and a bass line that jerks about like a disco dancing dad, which of course is a good thing! In this kind of form, two songs is barely enough, but if you wait a week or two there usually seems to be another release on the way.</p>
