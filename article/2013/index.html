    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for Buen Chico.</p>
    <p>Buen Chico’s songs have been described as a fiery mix of pop new wave, motown, alternative indie and punk, inspired by the likes of Supergrass, The Ramones, The Smiths, Weezer, The Flaming Lips, The Pixies and The Beatles!<br><br>They are a Leeds-based band and were re-formed in late 2003 after a major line-up change.<br><br>Morgan found Kirsty, the bass player, first – she’d nearly given up her search for the right band as it was getting a bit like trying to find a badger with an afro! But they both liked Velvet Underground [amongst many other bands], and it soon became clear they also both had a ferocious love of music.<br><br>The right drummer was even mor difficult to find ... it needed to be someone who - fitted in, who was able to hit pretty hard, pretty fast and pretty much in time! Eventually Kirsty remembered she knew of somebody who might fit the bill – Big Al. Just a few minutes into a session in a Leeds practise room, it became clear that he could hit the drums in exactly the manner required, and thus the third member was found - Buen Chico was up and running.<br><br>That was in September ’03 – 12 months later, the 3-man [sorry Kirsty!] format is working really well and the band is going from strength-to-strength with a load of new songs coming through. Highlights of the first year together included;<br><br>Kirsty starting to sing backing vocals - she's got a great voice!<br><br>London gigs like Club Fandango, The Archway Tavern, 93 Feet East etc.<br><br>Doing the Leeds Bright Young Things then being a Futuresound winner and playing Leeds Festival.<br><br>Signing a management deal with Pure Wonder [alias Ugly Man Media].<br><br>David Kosten of Faultline and EMI fame getting interested in us then doing some demo recordings with him at the flash Jacobs Studios down in Surrey - we've still got one or two things in the pipeline there and obviously hope things will develop.<br><br>Other labels showing interest and saying nice things about our stuff.<br><br>Year 2 saw a gradual development in the band’s overall look – more songs coming along and Kirsty developing her backing vocals.<br><br>Getting on the Queens of Noize ‘Best of 2005’ compilation album with people likeMystery Jets, Maximo Park, The Rakes & The Pippetes + doing a gig with these guys at the Camden Barfly. Apart from London, gigging as far afield as Southampton and Newcastle.<br><br>We put out our first single through Pure Wonder – Killing Somebody – which has sold very well and got quite a lot of good reviews. This sparked interest from the Manchester-based indie label, Faith & Hope [Mint Royale, Morning Runner etc]. They came to a few gigs and practice sessions, then we did a bit of recording work with their Neil Claxton which was a really interesting and useful session.<br><br>After much discussion with various labels, we were signed to Faith & Hope and have already recorded the first single at 80 Hertz studios in Manchester. The single will be released on July 10th..</p>
