In April 2007 Jon completed work on the first Laboratory Noise music video for the track 'You Created a Storm'. <br /><br />The video can be found on the debut, 5 track EP 'Hope is a Waking Dream', self-released in October 2007 on their Recurring Accident label. The EP can be purchased on CD from the band website.<br /><br />In 2007 the band provided the soundtrack to the Channel 4 documentary 'My Crazy Life: The boy who went to war', and have had songs appear on compilations for Mono, Soundpeople and the Timeless Project, as well as a Studio411 skateboarding DVD in the USA.<br /><br />Live highlights include playing alongside iLiKETRAiNS, Asobi Seksu, Jeffrey Lewis, Longview, Insect Guide, Dufus, Falconetti, Downdime, I Concur, Glissando, Piskie Sits, the Lightshines, worriedaboutsatan, Laura Groves & many more.<br /><br />After along time in the studio their debut LP, 'When Sound Generates Light', was released in June 2010 to favorable reviews.
