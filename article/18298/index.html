    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for Issimo.</p>
    <p>After Abi won Rock The House 2013 at The House of Commons, she paired up with 2012 runner up Marc and formed ISSIMO along with a band of rogue jazz musicians. They were spotted at The Bedford in Balham (performing acoustically) by an organiser from Festival Republic and were offered a slot at Latitude Festival where they received an overwhelming response from festival goers. ISSIMO went on to play Beat-Hearder festival and Bingley Music Live the same year. Since then they have been in the studio working on their debut EP with producer Roni Szpakowski which is set to be released in summer 2014. <br /><br />ISSIMO are strongly supported by BBC introducing and Alan Raw (West Yorkshire Presenter) is a great advocate and classes himself as a big ISSIMO fan. Popular tracks "Pretty Simple" and "Things About You" received radio play on the BBC Mark Forrest Show which is aired nationally across BBC stations. After recently playing a sell out gig at The 360 Club @ The Library in Leeds they are raring to go.<br /><br />What They Say<br />"Marc and Abi write, sing and perform perfect songs. Lyrically inspired, melodically masterful and rhythmically engaging, they make music that I love to hear " Tony Moore director of Music Art and Development at The Bedford, Balham London<br /><br />'Marc is a stupendous songwriter and guitarist, and has the potential to be a huge talent, imbued with a Jake Bugg/Alex Turner grip on the modern pulse, and the surging guitar chops of Johnny Marr. Abi is an alluring and stunning songstress with a staggering voice and heart-melting looks; together they are going to be a massive future proposition.' - Sam Liddicott (musicmusingsandsuch)<br /><br />"Positive Feedback and in particular the performance of ISSIMO...your contribution was indeed one of the highlights of the events" Lord Mayor of Bradford Councillor Khadim Hussain<br /><br />"Great Tunes, tight band and wonderful live, ones to watch out for"  Richard Watson 360 Club.</p>
