    <p>After two and a half years of pipe-dreaming, plotting and planning (along with the odd catastrophe thrown in for good measure), the Leeds Music Hub can finally announce Saturday 19th May as its launch day. <br /><br />The 19th and 20th will be a preview weekend for the Hub, with everyone invite to come and see the space, try out our café and chat about plans for the Hub. Normal opening hours start from Wednesday 23rd May.<br /><br />From its premises in Wood Lane, Headingley LS6, the Hub will be a tangible day-time presence of the Leeds music community. The space will house a café and social area; a local music and ticket shop; three teaching rooms for instrumental and vocal tuition from the local music scene's active performers; and a workshop area for seminars, masterclasses, meeting groups and other events. In addition, the Hub will also run local music posters and artwork exhibitions, acoustic sets/in-store performances and a local music archive (with items of Leeds music history currently stretching back to 1998).<br /><br />The Hub concept has been developed by a collective of local musicians and funded by UnLtd, Leeds City Council and Leeds University.<br /><br />The Hub will be open as a drop-in shop five days a week, offering the chance to immerse yourself in local music, underscored by homemade cakes and coffee.<br /><br />Read our interview with Kate from The Leeds Music Hub.<br /><br />Address: The Coach House, 20 Wood Lane, LS6 2AE. <br /><br />Open Wednesday-Saturday 12-7pm and Sunday 12-6pm.</p>
