    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for Buzzkill.</p>
    <p>Buzzkill are a rock band hailing from Leeds, West Yorkshire. Some people say they play rock 'n' roll, some people say they're more punk rock, one thing that's not disputed is that they play LOUD!<br><br>The Buzzkill of today was formed at the turn of the millennium. No longer a band of schoolmates playing Nirvana covers in Joe's garage, these guys were now ready to take their uniquely brassed up punk rock ‘n’ roll onto the road and have since  played alongside bands including The Distillers, Pretty Girls Make Graves, Hot Water Music, Goldblade, The Hunns, Horrorpops, Capdown and The Damned.<br><br>In the autumn of 2002 came their self-financed debut 7" which found it's way onto Radio 1's 'The Lock-up' and shortly after their debut CD 'Double Down' (on In at the Deep End Records) which hit the shelves in April 2003 and received much adoration from the press.<br><br> "Like an avant-garde jazz troupe rucking with the Clash as they both fall down a flight of stairs. Now that's entertainment! KKKK" - Kerrang<br><br> "Forget your old favourite band and vote Buzzkill! 8/10" - Rocksound<br><br>"...With West Yorkshire's very own hot-wired Richard Hell fronting a veritable firestorm of riff-propelled sass, Buzzkill will rekindle your faith in delinquent rock 'n 'roll 7/10" - Metal Hammer<br><br>"No punches pulled or hidden agendas, just fast, loud, hookladen rock 'n' roll. That's all you need!" - Fracture<br><br>Following the release of Double Down, Buzzkill continued to play further afield, touring the pubs, clubs, and squats of Germany, Switzerland and Holland in Spring 2003.<br><br>Since then Buzzkill hit somewhat of a hiatus because their original bass player Joe Osborne felt his time with the band was done. But upon enlisting one time stand in bassist Carl Glover to take Joe's place, a fresh drive and passion was instilled in the ranks. With the five piece as solid as ever, and their involuntary slowing down well and truly in the past, they set about writing a whole bunch of new material. 13 songs of which will manifest themselves this October as their debut full length album, "DRIVEN BY LOSS"! And with these brand new songs comes a brand new swagger, so be sure to check them out live!.</p>
