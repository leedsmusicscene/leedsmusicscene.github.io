    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for Soul Circus.</p>
    <p>Introducing purveyors of British indie rock and roll, guitar wielding Leeds' lads Soul Circus.<br /><br />With their anthemic and memorable songs Soul Circus have managed to lodge their infectious choruses in to the minds and hearts of music fans up and down the country, not least in their hometown where they were selected as runners up in the prestigious Futuresound 2010 competition to earn a slot at Leeds and Reading Festival.<br /><br />The five piece indie rock band has a live set packed full of epic anthems thrown together with an impressive mix of energy and swagger. On record they often draw on a shared love for The Killers, Editors and Doves to produce catchy well crafted pop that has the potential to make some of their peers envious, mixed in with the majesty and size of a U2 or Coldplay.<br /><br />Live reviews rave of the band being; "One of the tightest live bands around in Leeds" (The Beat Surrender) on the back of gigs supporting the likes of Sound of Guns and White Belt Yellow Tag. Their performances also captured the attention of the Live At Leeds Festival promoters who added them to the bill with bands such as The Sunshine Underground, Wild Beasts and The Bronx.<br /><br />Soul Circus have relentlessly continued to push themselves to become one of the driving live forces in Leeds with their stunning mix of energetic live shows combined with a natural confidence in their ability which shows all the signs of a future festival headline act.<br /><br />Soul Circus are Lloyd Bradley (lead vocals), Paul Wainwright (guitar and vocals), Tom Matthews (guitar), Adam Marshall (bass and vocals), and Martyn Guy (drums).<br /><br /><br /><br />"The performance has so much energy and goes suitably with the music, it's difficult to not be amazed by these guys...  It's difficult to overstate how much potential these guys have, and they're still unsigned. Definitely a band I look forward to hearing more from." (moonandbackmusic.com)<br /><br />"We won't be surprised if Soul Circus are impressing festival crowds in the summer ... their sound packs in enough originality to justify the solid reputation that this lot have been developing locally and nationally." (Sphere Magazine)<br /><br />"The unsigned lads look to have it all, the good looks, jaunty haircuts, trendy boots, and most importantly solid tunes and a strong stage presence." (Huddersfield Examiner).</p>
