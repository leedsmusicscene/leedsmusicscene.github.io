    <p>Leeds aggro-folk mob Bootscraper have announced the release of their second album - titled 'Eponymous' - on 18th June.<br /> <br />Employing a wide variety of musical styles and cultures in their music, 'Eponymous' features 10 original tracks of aggressive folk, punk, Balkan, Americana, Latin, Country and Celtic inspired music written by the band and recorded by Robert Hobson at Silent City Studios in the winter of 2011.<br /><br />Bootscraper have been building a good reputation and following on the local scene as well as other cities and festivals around the country, because they're a band that whet the appetite to get off one's arse and raise a jug of ale with their chaotic live performances. Their songs are full of life, each with a story to tell especially if you like a bit of substance to your music, knowingly ironic.<br /><br />Tim Loud told us "We are extremely excited to have finished our self-titled second album. The production started way back last summer, with help from Robert Hobson at Silent City Studios we've created something that we're all very proud of, and feel it really captures the energy of our live shows. The album sees us honing our music into a sound we believe is, unique sound and instantly recognisable as being ours with all the vim, vigour and ferocity that our fans have come to expect from us with a few softer moments thrown in. This album is raw, passionate, gritty, unapologetic, brimming with emotion and packed full of energy."<br /><br />Bootscraper will launch their new album at the 360 Club at The Library on Friday 15th June, where they are playing with Dexter Dextrous and The Fingersmiths, X Ray Cat Trio and Look Yonder.</p>
