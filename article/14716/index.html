    <p>Community radio station East Leeds FM is calling out to all local musicians, bands, singers, writers and poets to join in the first ever Live Broadcast Festival in East Leeds.<br /><br />Live@chapel is a 7 day festival of words and music, being broadcast live from Seacroft Methodist Chapel on East Leeds FM.<br /><br />The festival begins on Monday 13th June with Writing on Air - 5 full days of the best in poetry, story-telling, literature, and journalism. The words part of the festival ends on the Friday with a through-the-night reading and will then hand over to the musicians, with the ELFM Musicathon - a 24-hour continuous broadcast of live music.<br /><br />The Musicathon event first ran in April 2009, with over 300 musicians of all ages and musical backgrounds taking part and with over 3000 listeners tuning in. <br /><br />The line-up of writers and musicians already signed up looks impressive, with over 300 again likely to take part. However the organisers are hoping to attract some more younger, up-and-coming local writers and performers to get involved. <br /><br />Anyone interested in taking part at this year's live@chapel festival should email katy [ at ] headstogether.org attaching a recording of some of their work, written pieces or link to their webpage.<br /><br />Organisers hope that this year's festival will draw attention to the beautiful Seacroft Methodist Chapel, which ELFM aims to convert into a permanent base for the community radio station.</p>
