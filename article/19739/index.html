    <p>The award-winning Girl Gang community is launching in Leeds, bringing events which aim to support and celebrate women's work. <br /><br />Girl Gang Leeds' official launch party will take place on Friday 17th February at Sela Bar. The free event will feature female DJs playing music fronted by women, and will be open to all genders. Attendees can take part in a charity raffle for exclusive goodies, and have the opportunity to meet new people and to chat to the Girl Gang Leeds team.<br /><br />Having already gained an enthusiastic following from their online launch this week, future plans for the volunteer-led, non-profit community include arts and crafts markets featuring all-girl stallholders and businesses, art exhibitions, parties and social networking events.<br /><br />Girl Gang Leeds will be running a networking session at FemFest, a multi-arts festival celebrating women artists and musicians in Leeds, on Sunday 12th February at Hyde Park Book Club. They will also be running an arts & crafts fair on Sunday 5th March at The Social in celebration of International Women's Day.<br /><br />Girl Gang Leeds founder, Kaz Scattergood, says: "We're here to spread the positivity and excitement that's already been so successful in Sheffield and Manchester. It's about women supporting each other, celebrating each other's successes and giving creative people a platform.<br /> <br />"As well as holding our own events, we'll be looking to collaborate with existing local communities and art groups to bring even more ambitious events to the city."<br /><br />Prior events include a screening of The Punk Singer, a documentary about Kathleen Hanna and the riot grrl movement of the 1990s, which was accompanied by positivity workshops, screen-printing, a market of female stallholders, and a live gig of female-fronted punk bands. Other events in Sheffield and Manchester have included screenings of Mean Girls, craft markets, networking and Halloween parties.<br /><br />Sela Bar manager, Emily Cullen, says: "It'll be a pleasure to host Girl Gang Leeds events at Sela Bar, and indeed to see further events across the city. It's really important to support local initiatives that bring creative people together."<br /><br />Jeremy Arblaster, events manager at Nation of Shopkeepers, is keen to have the team on board in Leeds. He says: "Girl Gang is one of the best initiatives run by some of the best people I've met. It's the positivity that 2017 needs."<br /><br />To get in touch with Girl Gang Leeds, you can find them on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram @girlgangleeds.</p>
