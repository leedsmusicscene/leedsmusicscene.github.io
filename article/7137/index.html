    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for Jason Wakefield.</p>
    <p>Jason Wakefield is the name of a unique one-man electronic orchestra.<br />
<br />
Jason was initially a Leeds University student studying Theatre, however he soon realised that it wasn't the future he intended to have. He was able to push himself into leaving university, risking any stable future he may have made for himself, and instead he now focuses entirely on his one true passion: the eerie, philisophical and often dramatic and emotional music he composes and performs on his electric piano with built in studio.<br />
<br />
His band influences range from Radiohead and Muse, to Nine Inch Nails, Marilyn Manson and KoRn, though his major influence lies within the orchestral scores to horror films. The resulting style is one that defies genre, and can be labelled as some form of alternative electronic/classical.<br />
<br />
His demo takes the form of a 10 song concept album, entitled "Reflection Of Perception: The Conviction Of Scarlett Rivers"..</p>
