    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2013.</p>
    <p>Here is our guide to Beacons Festival 2013!<br /><br />TOP 5 DJ's to see:<br /><br />Oneman<br /><br />Having previously headlined Beacons' Greendale Stage in 2012, the London based party starter has been invited for round two in 2013. It is of course, Rinse FM's, Oneman. With performances at Sonar, Hideout and Y01 festival this year already under his belt, Skipton are to be graced by one of the highly sort out DJ's in the game, AGAIN! As always, Oneman will provide an eclectic mix of tunes to welcome you into the weekend on the Friday evening. <br /><br />Andres & Theo Parrish <br /><br />To anyone interested in House music, Andres shouldn't be a stranger to their ITunes library. His 'New For U' EP, released last year, was crowned the cream of the crop for 2012 by Resident Advisor and was in the top 10 singles for DJ Mag too. The Detroit DJ will be making his way to Skipton this summer for a special set going back to back with fellow American, Theo Parrish. Making what will be a festival exclusive for the UK. Expect a mash up of House and Techno and what will send any festivalgoer out with a big bang on the Sunday evening.<br /><br />Bicep<br /><br />Hailed as DJ mag's breakthrough duo of the year, Northern Ireland's very own Bicep will be entertaining the Beacons crowds. Well known for their up to date blog, Feelmybicep, the Belfast boys are fast rising stars after the release of the popular 'Visions Of Love' EP and the 'You/Don't' EP on AUS music has seen them collaborate on a new track with Simian Mobile Disco to great applause. Make sure you catch their mixture of Jersey house inspired tracks, which have captivated the audiences of 2013's House scene. <br /><br />T. Williams<br /><br />Introducing the newly added Red Bull Music Academy stage to Beacons on Friday night, headliner and RBMA favourite, T. Williams. After creating an out and out banger of a remix for Breach's 'Fatherless' in 2011, Williams has only gotten better in terms of his own production.  His 2012 single 'Dreaming' which featured on Rinse FM's 21st compilation mix has seen him produce remixes for Wretch 32, Lianne La Havas and with a forthcoming release on PMR Records, T. Williams is no stranger to success in 2013. With a headline slot at Manchester's Parklife festival under his belt, expect the party to go on late with one of London's rising stars. <br /><br /><br />TOP 5 BANDS/ARTISTS to see: <br /><br />Local Natives<br /><br />Producing one of the best records of 2013 so far, LA heartbreakers, Local Natives will be visiting Heslaker Farm to headline the Saturday night of Beacons Festival. Their second album, Hummingbird, has had people stirring this half of the year due to its incredibly euphoric sounding melodies, backed by some of the dreamiest guitar and keys you've ever heard. It's hard not to be immersed in their live performance and after a successful Glastonbury appearance they are certainly the band to provide the soundtrack to match the romantic scenes of the Yorkshire dales. <br /><br />Danny Brown<br /><br />Detroit rapper, Danny Brown, joined the Beacons line up at the end of June being one of the latest acts to be announced. Expect carnage, as Brown is soon to release his third album, Old, expected anytime in August and his performance will more than likely preview some new tracks. Having reportedly received oral sex on stage at one of his previous shows this year, the madman will be appearing on the Sunday night of the festival, which is definitely going to be a highlight of the weekend. Don't miss this!<br /><br />Ghostpoet<br /><br />Entertaining a packed out Brudenell Social Club in May, London's finest, Ghostpoet returns to Beacons Festival for a second year in a row. This time off the back of his second record, 'Some Say I, So I Say Light', him and his incredibly talented band shall be entertaining the masses on the Friday night. Ghostpoet's newest offering received well-deserved credit from the NME and The Guardian, so expect a showcase of jilted beats, keyboard and synths which resemble sparks of electricity and slurred raps on the main stage. <br /><br />Childhood<br /><br />This eccentric four piece describe themselves as a 'hot boy band from London, making tunes, making moves' which is exactly what you can expect if the weather is glorious. Making reverb drenched melodies, accompanied by delayed and spaced out guitar riffs they are capturing this summers sound.  Having first heard Childhood in 2012 with 'Blue Velvet' they certainly followed up the Tame Impala-esque feel releasing 'Solemn Skies' and 'Semester' in 2013. If you're looking for psych pop rock, then look no further. <br /><br />Wolf People<br /><br />Hailing from all parts of the country, including North Yorkshire, and having recorded their second album, Fain, in the Dales, they are no strangers to the Beacons surroundings.  Creating crunchy guitar riffs, with polished vocals and crashy drums, collectively they bringing together a mammoth wall of sound. If you enjoy beautifully crafted rock noises, then check out their performance on the Sunday at Beacons!<br /><br />Tickets are starting to sell quickly, so to avoid disappointment, head to - www.greetingsfrombeacons.com</p>
