    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for Touch, The.</p>
    <p>'07 is looking like it's going to be an exciting year for The Touch. It was kicked off with an entrance into Bright Young Things 2007, and there's much more to come with new records and a video on it's way, as well numerous U.K festival appearances and a mini-tour in the States. So hold on to your hats!<br />
<br />
The general consensus is that when The Touch play live they create a sound that belies their member count of 3, with George's huge valve-driven vintage tone, Jason's renowned big beat pounding, and Andy's thumping Entwistle-esque lead-bass style. They possess a mature dynamic ability that is rarely seen in today's 'indie' music scene; (In the words of Jimmy Page: "It's all about light and shade.") <br />
<br />
"They take prime Led Zeppelin stomp, Pink Floyd psychedelia, and The Who inspired choruses and fire them into the 21st Century through a New Order shaped canon, and serve it all up in a Blues Pie, with an occasional side order of Reggae Salad." - Old Man River.<br />
<br />
They completed their first UK tour in Summer 2006 which took them from Scotland to London stopping off at some of the best venues on the way including; The ABC-Glasgow, The Boardwalk-Sheffield, Fibbers-York, The Night &amp; Day-Manchester, The Cockpit-Leeds and The Dublin Castle-London. They have shared the stage with We Are Scientists, Milburn, The Pigeon Detectives, Wolf &amp; Cub, Hey Gravity! (ex. Dodgy guitarists new band), The Lovers (ex. Inspiral Carpets) and many more established artists. Their music found its way into HMV in 2005.<br />
<br />
They are always in the process of writing new material as George seems to be in his own world of music, words and colours most of the time..</p>
