    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "You Might As Well Try To Fuck Me EP" recorded by The Music. The review was written by Dave Sugden in 2001.</p>
    <p>"You Might As Well Try To Fuck Me" is the debut release from Leeds' The Music on the Hut label, and, put bluntly, is a blinding tune.  Centred around continuous waves of an indie-dance guitar base, overlaid with a further staunch guitar riff, the track also highlights the unique vocal delivery of Robert Harvey who sweeps the song along the main lyric.  Not since Super Furry Animal's "The Man Don't Give A Fuck" have I ever felt so enamoured with such a guitar-band-doing-a-dance-song vibe; the comparison with SFA is not in the sound, more in the fact it makes me want to get up and dance whilst singing along to their common use of one main lyric.<br><br>Whereas the title track is formed around the guitars, a major focal point in their style, the next two tracks - "Karma" and "Treat Me Right On" - build upon a vocal-based emotion along with simple, but effective, drum beats.  The guitar and bass still play a signicant, yet more background role, and the overall feeling is less intimidating and more relaxing.  A distinct variance from the previous norm, I'm not sure whether either track does it for me.  The jury is still out - it may take a few more listens yet.<br><br>Adam Nutter makes an effort to bring his guitar to the forefront again mid-way through the final track, "Too High" and features once more in a blazing outro.  An impressive tune, complete mix of feelings and attitudes, some great effects and a furthering of the Harvey school of vocals, this track leaves the listener with a consenting feeling.  A great end to a startlingly adept debut single from the Leeds four-piece.</p>
