        <h1>Many Leeds bands to play Galtres Festival this weekend</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2012.</p>
    <p>With coverage of a certain music festival taking a lot of the news headlines this weekend, one might be forgiven for thinking the rest of the music scene has shut down for a few days, taken its tents and decamped to Bramham Park. <br /><br />Yet that would be foolish talk; not only is Yorkshire a vast county, with plenty to offer its discerning music fans, but it would be an injustice to approximately 7,000 and the many national and regional bands that will be at the Galtres Festival.<br /><br />Galtres Festival is situated 12 miles to the north of York, in the gorgeous surroundings of Crayke, and headlining the weekend are The Buzzcocks, Ash, Seth Lakeman, Ocean Colour Scene, Guillemots, Adam Ant, Billy Bragg and The Men They Couldn't Hang.<br /><br />Joining them will be a large number of Leeds and West Yorkshire-based acts, including Hope & Social, Arthur Rigby & the Baskervylles, Ellen & the Escapades, Fossil Collective, Jon Gomm, Bootscraper, Gary Stewart, Marc Otway, Rupert Stroud, Monkey Anna, Handmadehands, Aelfen, Sarah Horn and James Cudworth, Three Sheets T'Wind, Steve Chapman Smith, Roger Davies, Josh Fowley and Feeds. <br /><br />Now eight years old, Galtres Festival is one of the best family festivals in the country. Combining five stages of music and cabaret, more than 100 fine beers and ciders all from Yorkshire, excellent local produce catering, loads for kids to do from film making to music workshops, and all set in a beautiful rural setting overlooking the Vale of York. <br /><br />It's organic, fair trade and green, and all proceeds go to charity. <br /><br />The festival runs from Friday 24th August through to Sunday 26th August and tickets are still available here.</p>
