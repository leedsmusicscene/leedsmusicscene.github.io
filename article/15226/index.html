    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for Pink Peg Slax.</p>
    <p>Anarchic rockabilly beloved by the late John Peel. "If Elvis had been a Marx Brother, he would have invented Pink Peg Slax" (James Brown, NME) With a name derived from an obscure Eddie Cochran rocker, Pink Peg Slax promise rockabilly revivalism, but these veterans of the Leeds 80s music scene deliver musical subversion. Borne out of punk, the Slax line-up were original members of the Mekons, the Sisters of Mercy and The Gang of Four. Celebrated by John Peel and Andy Kershaw (4 Radio 1 sessions), the NME (3 singles and 2 albums gained 5-star reviews) and TV chef Keith Floyd (who wrote sleeve notes) Pink Peg Slax knocked out 100% original tunes with a deft rockabilly-cajun approach. Pink Peg Slax provided the necessary knowing wink to counter the gothic scowl on the face of indie music in the mid-80s. The Smiths released Meat Is Murder; the Slax released Eat More Meat. The only band ever to offer James Cagney impressions as serious musical output on night-time Radio One, Pink Peg Slax busked their way onto C4's The Tube, annoyed legions of Goths by supporting The Mission on tour and wrote songs about drunken pigs, deaf railwaymen, murderous Frenchmen and Holsten Pils. Frontman Vince Berkeley, often at odds with the world and the time of day, once thanked an audience of fairground workers for not being "gippos", told an indifferent audience in Dusseldorf to "go away and make some chemicals" and regularly spat on, kicked or threatened audience members he felt were disrespecting the band. And yet the band's Roman Catholicism led to album reviews in The Universe, the premier UK religious weekly. After a break of 20 years to raise families and conquer the world of work, Pink Peg Slax return with their original line-up and most of their hair intact..</p>
