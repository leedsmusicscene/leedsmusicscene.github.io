        <h1>Pigzipper - Untitled</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Untitled" recorded by Pigzipper. The review was written by Richard Garnett in 2005.</p>
    <p>With a badly scribbled post-it note as an inlay Pigzipper introduce themselves with little decorum. The same impatience with which they hastily prepared for a review seems to have also influenced the giddy desire to fill out this 10 song album with everything they have ever committed to tape... well CD. For the most part the one dimensional laid-back groove, non-committal reedy vocal style and weedy home production makes this a trying journey. No one should love a chorus effect on their vocals this much! Pigzipper sound a bit like Gomez, an acoustic Soundgarden and when they are feeling “groovy” The Fun Loving Criminals. They are not devoid of ideas and playfulness as guitar exercise of samba beat Roundabout demonstrates or the opening groove of Lost? The smooth soul intro of Seven Sundays is nice and the unnamed hidden track is actually worth waiting 15 minutes for. But and sadly it’s a big one, there are one too many faux pas to let Pigzipper get off with all charges dropped. If the title of Sweet Darlin’ (missing a “G” and who uses the word Darlin anyway?) was not warning enough then the god awful white man dad rap will have you reaching for the rifle. It’s only just short of “I was walking down the street just the other day, and this guy came up to me and said hey!” bad bad Robbie Williams BAD! Oh no it's here again on Seven Sundays ruining the aforementioned nice start. Then start counting up the pompous well used samples about war and bombs, the number of clichéd melodies, the rather bad cover of Prince’s Starfish & Coffee and the just plain dull Happy or even duller Wonderland and Pigzipper you are guilty of some of the oldest crimes against music, but with time, patience and building on the good bits you will get off for good behaviour.</p>
