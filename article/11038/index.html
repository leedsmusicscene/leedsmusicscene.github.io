    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for Lisa George and The Pedalos.</p>
    <p>Hot rockin' sexy rockabilly... and that's just the Pedalos! Lisa George, the 21st century sweetheart rock'n'roll glamour puss, is here and she is destined to be the UK's no.1 female rockabilly songstress. Her debut album, "The Devil Said Shake" is due out on Raucous Records very soon and will be closely followed by the CD single, "Blue-Eyed Rockabilly Boy", self-penned by Lisa herself. On the demo CD you will hear a selection of the tracks from the forthcoming releases and we hope you enjoy them as much as we did making them.<br /><br />With a mixture of classic covers and many brand new original songs, "The Devil Said Shake" combines the old and the new wrapped up in one of the most authentically 50's sounding releases you're likely to hear this side of 1960. Why is it so authentically 50's sounding? Well, the 50's came to us by way of the legendary Riverside Studios in Blackpool using only original RCA ribbon mics, tape machines and compressors - all live, down & dirty and the result; a powerhouse sound banging on the speaker walls.<br /><br />Lisa George may be a familiar face among avid 'Corrie', 'Holby City', Casualty', 'City Central' fans in her acting career and her mighty voice has also been a part of many theatre musical shows including, 'The Queens Of Country', 'Prisoner Cell Block H', 'I Only Want To Be With You - the Dusty Springfield Story', plus vocal starlet in jumpin' R'n'B bands, 'The Rumble Band', 'The Big Heat' and 'The Cat Pack', where she was part of the support act to rock'n'roll legends Chuck Berry and Little Richard. Now and again Lisa also dips in and out of session / touring work where she has been backing vocalist to The Stranglers and Joe Longthorne amongst many other artists.<br /><br />The Pedalos comprise of several seasoned rockin' circuit musicians, all with the same love, passion and eye for a good rockin' tune. Amongst the band credits include Richard Hawley, Albert Lee, Charlie Gracie, The Drifters, The Sharp Cuts, The Slingshots, Cathouse Creepers; rock'n'roll theatre shows, 'Buddy', 'Rave On', 'Legends Reborn', 'The Elvis Collection'; and general freelance work with Peter Grant, Bucks Fizz, Georgie Fame and many other artists.<br /><br />Lisa George and The Pedalos are a brand new band adding their own mix into the rockabilly melting pot and are currently on the hunt for gigs nationwide and beyond. Take a listen to the enclosed demo, have a look at the MySpace site for further info and we hope you like what you hear and are willing to help us in our hunt spreading rockabilly voodoo vibes..</p>
