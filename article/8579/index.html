        <h1>International Trust - Talk of The Town</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Talk of The Town" recorded by International Trust. The review was written by Richard Garnett in 2007.</p>
    <p>International Trust are about as complicated as beans on toast. You think this is a derogatory statement? Think again schmuck. Why else, for years, has beans on toast been the staple diet of millions who crave something quick, tasty and satisfying? Because simple works, that’s why! All too often of late that book for musicians “How to keep it simple and be ace” has been gathering dust on the shelf in favour of more modern titles such as “How to create a genre by adding the word NEW (or Nu) in front of it” or “How to combine trigonometry and music: 3.6 easy steps”. International Trust are doing for punk what Andrew WK did for rock: they are putting the pleasure back in and they’re not ashamed about it. Why should they be with melodies and hooks as tall as the latest additions to the Leeds skyline? It is no mean feat to write songs as instantly memorable as “Talk of The Town” and “Disneyland” while avoiding them sounding contrived or naff. It won’t even take one listen to be singing along with Neil Hanson’s badly looked after vocal as he gnarls out “We’re off to Disneee-laaand”, you’ll be doing it by the third chorus. Like Carter USM replete with cheap keyboards but minus the annoying “we’re from fackin Laandan” references this is a return to the purist days when disco beats were for disco and rave never spoke to metal. This is a manifesto for good clean noisy dirty guitar accompanied by a healthy “Oi” and dubious body odour. There are even bloody key changes… no-one does key changes any more, brilliant! Things only come off the boil for the relative ballad “I can’t believe you fell in love (with a bastard like me)” which lingers slightly too long and pushes the keyboard too much into the realms of a Spanish hotel bar. But fear not, normal service is resumed with the sneering two-fingered salute to the shallow music industry by which we are all surrounded. “Show me the money” features one of the greatest examples of call and response backing vocals ever committed to…hard drive? Put it another way, if The Pigeon Detectives had done it, the kids would be happy to lick it off the pavement.</p>
