    <p>Dinosaur Pile-up have announced that they will be hosting an intimate Q+A session with fans next week. The band will also be performing a live set.<br /><br />The session, which takes place at the Brudenell Social Club in Leeds on Wednesday, 13th July, is being arranged in coordination with Miller Genuine Draft. <br /><br />The Leeds-born trio are set to give supporters an exclusive insight into their personal tales and favourite nights out in Leeds as well as treating fans to an intimate gig as part of the "It's Miller Time Live Presents" sessions.  <br /> <br />Those in attendance will be given the opportunity to quiz the band in a specially arranged Q&A session, after which the band will perform live with the set closer being chosen on the night by fans.<br /> <br />Matt Bigland said, "The Miller show at the Brudenell will be awesome. The Bru is a really important venue to us. It's where I recorded a lot of the first DPU demos and played the first few shows. I used to carry my drum kit down there and record drums all day. It was a beginning for DPU. There'll be a lot of friends there for us."<br /> <br />This first ever "It's Miller Time Live Presents" session kicks off a series of events that will see some of the hottest acts in the UK re-visit their home town, tell tales about some of their best nights out in the city and end the night with a live performance that's not to be missed.<br /><br />Support on the night comes from Yonderboy.<br /><br />A limited numbers of tickets for the event remain and will be available for FREE via a prize draw run via the @ItsMillerTimeUK team on Twitter.<br /><br />You will be contacted by reply with details.</p>
