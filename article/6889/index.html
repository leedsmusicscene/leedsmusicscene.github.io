        <h1>Yes Boss - More Or Less / They Think It's All Over</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "More Or Less / They Think It's All Over" recorded by Yes Boss. The review was written by Luke Ramsden in 2006.</p>
    <p>After the unprecedented amount of useless, mindless, lager lout England World Cup anthems that have been hastily penned by cretins wanting the football loving nation to embrace (let’s not get started on Embrace) their song and sing it from the terraces, it’s refreshing to hear the remedy to this in the form of Yes Boss’ incidental attack on football fever that is ‘They Think It’s All Over’. A tongue in cheek, well constructed tale of what you could be doing if you weren’t stuck on the sofa in front of the TV on a Saturday afternoon. As with previous single ‘Indie Kids’, even if you don’t quite agree with the message on offer, it’s worthy of respect because there’s more than a few amusing and insightful lyrics that warrant a knowing smile. “Yes miss, I understand your pain /your man's got Beckham on  the brain” being just one.<br><br>‘More Or Less’ is a little more innocuous, sounding similar to a more low tempo ‘Meet The Boss’, the grimecore beats are the highlight and a still worthy addition to Yes Boss’ increasing reputation as  frontrunners in the fledgling Leeds’ hip-hop scene.</p>
