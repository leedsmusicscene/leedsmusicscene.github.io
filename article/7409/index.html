    <p>A five day celebration of Irish arts and culture kicks off in Leeds from the 9th-13th of November. Dozens of events including music sessions, literary, film and theatrical events and talks are planned to take place at venues across Leeds, bringing Ireland’s finest artists to the city.<br><br>Organized by the Irish Arts Foundation, based in Leeds, events are designed to appeal to both those of an Irish background and people from the wider community with an interest in music and the arts. Des Hurley, Project Director explains, “The idea is to provide a unique opportunity for the Irish community in Leeds to showcase their rich and vibrant cultural traditions.”<br><br>The festivities will be opened by the Lord Mayor of Leeds at the Official Launch Event in the Irish Centre and events continue till Monday night. Performing artists include well known Irish traditional duo, Nollaig Casey & Arty McGlynn, singer Cara Dillon, London based young traditional group Elan and from Waterford, Hiberno-jazzers The Moving Statues. In addition to these, watch out for the extensive list of musicians from across Ireland, Scotland and England booked to play on the ‘session trail’.<br><br>The best in music is not all that’s happening here though, three films (Poitin, Contempo Goes West and the iconic Mise Eire) are to be screened, there are literary events involving local and visiting poets, comedy, a play from Leeds CCE, various displays and a lecture as well.<br><br>In short, there’s something for everyone so visit Leeds on the weekend of the 9th and be a part of the crowds at the 2006 Leeds Gathering.<br><br>For further info contact Irish Arts Foundation on 0113 2755665 or visit the website www.irisharts.org.uk.</p>
