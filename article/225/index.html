        <h1>Jumpcut - Hungry Wise</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Hungry Wise" recorded by Jumpcut. The review was written by Dan Pullinger in 2002.</p>
    <p>Jumpcut describe the opening track of their debut single release as "a pop tune and as such a blatant attempt to crack the Top Ten", but it can safely be assumed that this is tongue-in-cheek optimism from the instrumental three-piece. Indeed, opener Comes and Goes is a flowing, layered synth number, almost sci-fi in its artificiality, that is unlikely to have the screaming pre-teen hordes breaking down the doors of their local multi-national record store. Second track 19 Stars, meanwhile, is an understated, chilled-out number that, while demonstrating the trio's creative range, lacks any real edge.<br><br>The title of the third track, "Hey! Not So Fast Poindexter!" might conjure up thoughts of cheesy 80s Brat Pack movies and their associated soft-rock soundtracks, but in fact Jumpcut offer a bizarre, spritely piece, led by dramatic piano-playing that would be better suited as an accompaniment to a tragic art-house flick from the silent era.<br><br>Final track Free Falling Forwards is supposedly an accidental creation by the band, brought to life during a recording session. Undoubtedly the strongest track on the album, despite a whopping running time of 14 minutes, it gives a nod to some of the Chemical Brothers' finer moments. After a decidedly quiet six minutes, punctuated only by what seems to be the sound of distant thunder and chirping crickets, the track springs dramatically to life with a combination of looped keyboard squawl and drum rolls, with a little bit of dirty bass guitar noise thrown in for good measure.</p>
