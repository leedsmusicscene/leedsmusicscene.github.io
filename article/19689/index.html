    <p>Underground music broadcaster Boiler Room and O2 have today announced an exciting opportunity with Go Think Big, allowing young people across the UK a chance to work on the iconic Boiler Room live streams and learn about the skills required to succeed in the modern music industry.<br /> <br />The partnership is looking to offer young people across the country the chance to work on one of two unique, live-streamed gigs in London and Leeds, via its work experience initiative GoThinkBig.<br /><br />Designed to help those who attend take their first steps into the music industry workshops will be taking place in both London and Leeds with up to 80 places on offer.<br /><br />Successful entrants will be picked by a panel of judges to undertake a series of once-in-a-lifetime workshops as Boiler Room opens its doors for the first time ever, culminating in them putting on gigs in a never before used space at O2 Academy Brixton and underground O2 Academy Leeds.<br /><br />The selected applicants will learn about booking and producing a live show, how to best use social media and market an event, how to broadcast and use live streaming equipment as well as completing a course in content creation and post production. All the skills necessary for success in the increasingly digital music industry.<br /><br />Following the workshops, a number of participants will get the chance to work closely with a professional counterpart to put on the gigs, which are scheduled to take place at the beginning of December.<br /><br />The remaining applicants will be given further opportunities to shadow Boiler Room staff on future projects and GoThinkBig will also be making other work experience positions available via its dedicated music page over the next six months. <br /><br />Launched in 2012 and run by O2, GoThinkBig is a website dedicated to helping young people gain valuable skills through work experience and careers advice. Unlike other job sites GoThinkBig provides contacts and work experience opportunities in the hardest to break industries.  More than 250,000 young people use the site to browse work placements and by the end of 2015 the programme will have offered 30,000 experience and skills opportunities to 16-24 year olds. <br /><br />This campaign follows in the footsteps of GoThinkBig's partnership with Rizzle Kicks in 2013, where 75 young people in the UK were recruited to work on the set of the music video for the band's hit track Lost Generation. In 2014, GoThinkBig teamed up with Nile Rodgers and Rudimental, seeing 100 young people recruited to remix and re-release CHIC's classic hit record 'Le Freak'. In 2015, GoThinkBig teamed up with the BFI to offer young people the chance to create a short film to be shown at the London Film Festival.<br /><br />Young people aged between 18 and 24 can apply now at www.gothinkbig.co.uk.</p>
