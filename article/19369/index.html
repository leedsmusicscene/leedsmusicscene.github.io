    <p>Registration for Centre Stage 2016 is now open and Martin House Children's Hospice, together with Reading & Leeds Festivals, look forward to the new search for the act who will ultimately claim the prize of playing at both Leeds and Reading, and a music performance video with Shot by Sodium.<br /><br />The competition has gone from strength to strength since its inception in 2009 and continues to receive involvement and support from Yorkshire bands Embrace, Pigeon Detectives, The Cribs and Pulled Apart by Horses. <br /><br />Now in its seventh year, the Centre Stage Competition, which raises vital funds for the hospice, is inviting young bands and soloists of ANY genre to enter. <br /><br />Participants must be under 22 years old and in Yorkshire. To register, acts go to the Martin House website.<br /><br />Once registered, acts will be automatically entered into the Heats, which will take place on 18/19/20 April at the Belgrave Music Hall, Leeds.<br /><br />The finalists will then take to the stage at O2 Academy, Leeds, on 27th July, following a professional mentoring day.<br /><br />Entering Centre Stage is an invaluable link to the local music industry, especially those supportive of unsigned, young artists. It has provided connections and opportunities for many contenders, including those with BBC Introducing and M.A.S. Records. Impressively, Centre Stage finalists have gone on to perform at Glastonbury Festival have taken to the road to support both The Pigeon Detectives and Embrace.<br /><br />The competition hit the big Â£200,000 fundraising mark this year and the charity are keen to hear from any companies or individuals who would like to be involved and get on board as sponsors.</p>
