        <h1>Lewis Denby will release a double A-side single in February</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2007.</p>
    <p>Leeds-based musician Lewis Denby has this week revealed details of his latest double A-side single scheduled for release on 19th February. The CD features the songs “Threadbear” and “Vous”.<br><br>Raised on a diet of both popular and alternative music, Lewis Denby began playing as a young child and had progressed to songwriting by the age of twelve. It was a few years later, however, that his passion for the acoustic guitar came to the fore. Writing songs about life - his own, other people's, and in general - he pieced together a self-released debut CD at barely seventeen years old. Although 'Next Year' received mixed reviews, it prompted Lewis to press onwards, writing, recording and performing more music. This eventually resulted in his first full release: the acclaimed 'Lookout Posts and Telescopes' EP in July 2006, which music magazine Sandman called "absolutely beautiful," and to which Room Thirteen referred as "smooth, tuneful acoustic enlightenment." The success of the EP, released on his own GrooveStealer label, was furthered by a UK tour over the summer of 2006, which saw Lewis play nine cities over two weeks to a newly-discovered fanbase.<br><br>Experimenting with a more varied style and more ambitious instrumentation. Lewis is currently tucked away recording a brand new, full-length album, which will be unveiled further into 2007. The first of the new material is set for release this February: promotional double A-side 'Threadbear / Vous” serves as a taster of what the album will offer. In the run-up to the album, expect to see Lewis playing occasional shows around the UK.</p>
