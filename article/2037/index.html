    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for Electric Mud Generator.</p>
    <p>Duncan - Guitar / Vocals<br />Jonerator - Bass Guitar<br />Rick - Drums <br /><br />Electric Mud Generator are a Leeds based three-piece who formed in 2002. Having previously self-released an album in 2006, they put out their second recording - To the Disdain of Polyhymnia - in November 2008 on Total Prog Records, home of Leeds psychedelic monsters Humanfly.<br /><br />The band take influences from many sources including (amongst many others), Pink Floyd, Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds, Ulver, Hawkwind, Black Sabbath, Bauhaus, Electric Wizard, Richard Thompson and The Thamesmen.<br /><br />The band rarely play anything even loosely structured, opting instead to fumble around in the key of C-sharp and leave most of the work to Sir Landslip, their delay unit. Facing questions about this behaviour, the band have been known to mumble semi-coherently about 'dub influences'.<br /><br />The group's line-up consists of Duncan (guitar and vocals), Jon (bass) and Rick (drums) but they have been occasionally known to utilise arcane supernatural energies to supplement these earth-bound instruments.<br /><br />It is appropriate to finish with one of the only verified quotes from the band themselves, being as it is both poignant and deeply relevant:<br /><br />"It's too early for atmosphere; welcome to Planet Space.".</p>
