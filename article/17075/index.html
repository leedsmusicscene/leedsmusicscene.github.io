    </div>
    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2012.</p>
    <p>It's been a brilliant, busy and breathtaking four months of quality music, good times and hard work, all of which has served as a preamble for the main event: Oxjam Leeds Takeover 2012. <br /><br />The reception so far has been exceptional and Oxjam have raised a lot of money (£1,000) that will go towards worthwhile causes. They're looking to build on those successes with the brilliant finale and hit their £3,000 target. <br /><br />And with a line-up like the one they've got this year, anything is possible.<br /> <br />The Takeover will be happening across four of the best venues in Leeds on Saturday 20th October 2012: Nation of Shopkeepers, Massey's Bookseller, Escobar and The Fenton.<br /><br />Here you will find the crème de la crème of local talent performing original, absorbing and incredible music, alongside which will be a whole host of other entertainment, including live art and graffiti, a fancy dress photo booth, vintage/retro pop-up shop and much, much more.<br /> <br />"Oxjam is happening across the UK but we're particularly proud of Leeds Takeover, which is already the most successful series of events this city has ever known," said David Hewitt, Oxfam's North-East Regional Fundraising Manager. <br /><br />"The diversity of music we've seen to date and the way a team of such disparate volunteers have come together and worked so hard for a common purpose... it's all very Oxfam! Hundreds of music-lovers are going to have an amazing Takeover Day experience and take us to the team's fundraising goal."<br /> <br />Playing on the day are Louise Distras, Matt Abbott, We Were Frontiers, Fold, Dan Audio, M.A.S.K.S, Chief Wigz, Yannick, British Racing Green, ALASKA, Lisa Ella, The Wind-up Birds, Nervous Twitch, Bryon Street Social, Propane Penny, Paper Plane, Disraeli Gears, Life In Colour, Harry George Johns Band, Esper Scout, Reeds, Dockyard Thieves, Purple Thread and Feelix.<br /><br />Tickets are still available from Jumbo Records and Crash Records and the Oxjam Leeds Takeover 2012 starts at 2pm and ends late. <br /><br />An after party DJ-set will take place at Propaganda at O2 Academy where the first 200 ticket holders will receive a free MP3 mixtape download featuring artists playing at Takeover.<br /> <br />Note that some venues are 18+.</p>
