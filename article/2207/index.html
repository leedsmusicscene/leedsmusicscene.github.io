    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for Waking the Witch.</p>
    <p>Their voices range from haunting, delicate beauty to an explosion of soaring harmonies. Their lyrics bloom from a place of uncompromising honesty and naked emotion. Their roots are wedged in blues and R&B, rock and folk and the result is a sound that blends and transcends these genres into something unique and personal. But for Waking the Witch, this is just the beginning...<br><br>Conceived at the beginning of 2003, it didn't take long for the Yorkshire-based foursome, namely Patsy Matheson, Jools Parker, Becky Mills and Rachel Goodwin, to make their mark. With numerous live radio appearances, a completed tour of the North of England and some outstanding press reviews already under their belts, they are now firmly poised for the next stage, including a further tour in the Spring of 2004 and an appearance at Glastonbury Festival in the Summer...<br><br>All are acclaimed solo artists in their own right, with a musical pedigree to match. Patsy, Rachel and Jools have at one time or another shared stages with the likes of Christy Moore,  John Martyn, Mary Coughlan, Glen Tilbrook, Sam Brown and the Saw Doctors.<br><Br>With their stunning debut album 'Like Everybody', Waking the Witch are ready to write their own history. From the hauntingly beautiful Poet of Harlem with it's almost operatic climax, to the angst-ridden title track, the album shimmers and pops along, radiating womanly zest, energy and attitude.<br><br>Says Patsy: "When we started to write and arrange together we knew we had something special. We've all done solo projects before but as a foursome we feel we have more energy, more drive, more creativity. Waking the Witch is like being part of an extended family, it just feels right.".</p>
