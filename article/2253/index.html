    <p>Due to the success of the annual Futuresound competition and the mounting climate of the local music scene Futuresound Music Ltd has decided to launch a monthly unsigned showcase.<br><br>The night is designed to help break new talent and devoted to pampering the finest local acts in the area. This night will have unique features exclusive only to The Cockpit, such as frequent A & R interest, press coverage, competitive rates of pay for the bands and it may also lead to possible support slots with signed acts at the venue in the future.<Br /><Br />The opening night for this event has been confirmed as Saturday February 7th 2004.<br /><Br />This night is completely independent of the resident unsigned promoter of the Cockpit, John Trueman.<br><Br>The bands that perform on the showcase will also gain a good chance of being entered into the Futuresound competition. The annual Futuresound competition occurs in the summer months where the best local bands battle it out at the Cockpit for a slot at the Carling Weekend festival.<br><br>Bands wishing to play at the Futuresound monthly showcase should contact either: Charlotte Hird, charlotte@thecockpit.co.uk or Phil Slavin, phil@thecockpit.co.uk.</p>
