    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for Hooson.</p>
    <p>Hooson formed around the impressive talents of Jenna Hooson on vocals and Rich Kershaw on guitar, two performers considered by many to be amongst the best at what they do. Together with Nick Ezard on drums and Keith Gater on bass they play a powerful blend of steaming blues rock and soul that is hard to beat. Between them they have over forty years of experience, even though two of the band are still only in their twenties, and have played throughout the UK and Europe on a professional basis.<br /><br />Jenna and Rich formed the band to bring together their combined talents after receiving fantastic reactions from audiences whenever they would guest with each other at gigs. It is clear from every performance that the pair has a unique chemistry on stage that is compelling to watch. Jenna has been described as world class and "like a cross between Aretha Franklin and Robert Plant"¬ù, however she clearly has her own vocal identity which has both power and passion in equal measure. Rich's playing style is the perfect accompaniment to Jenna's vocals being both passionate and intense, gaining admiration from audiences and fellow players alike.<br /><br />With Nick and Keith providing a solid and tight foundation, the pair are able to display their talent to it's very best. Jenna and Rich also perform as a duo for more intimate settings and are always happy to do so. The band play a mixture of rocked up blues and soul, breathing new life and vibrancy into the genre. The band are currently working on original material and will be heading into the studio early in 2010 to record these and some of the songs from their live set for release on CD..</p>
