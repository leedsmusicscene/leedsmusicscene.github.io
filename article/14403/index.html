For example:<br /><br />- Do you want to host a night?<br />- Are you a venue interested in joining in?<br />- What do you want to see at Leeds Festival Fringe? <br /><br />Leeds Festival Fringe is open to everyone's ideas and the organisers are really excited by the fact that people have already come forward with their input and support. <br /><br />Although the support received so far has been tremendous, they still need your help, from spreading the word of Leeds Festival Fringe through to re-posting their logo, from joining their Facebook page and liking their website. <br /><br />Visit the Leeds Festival Fringe website for more information and to join the mailing list.</p>
