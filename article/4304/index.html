        <h1>Rhode Island - Happy Birthday EP</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Happy Birthday EP" recorded by Rhode Island. The review was written by Ben Daure in 2005.</p>
    <p>The first thing I noticed when this CD started playing was that … it was amazing! I’m not just saying that to avoid being harsh to the band (which I have noticed happens too much), this EP is truly incredible. I know you probably hear this a lot, but it actually sounds extremely original. The EP gives off a Beatles-type feel, with acoustic guitar work similar to Nikoli, but it seems to flow together just that little bit better.<br><br>Rhode Island have put together a truly fantastic EP, the tracks are well produced (as is the very nice packaging) and it’s very obvious they have spent a lot of time making these songs sound exactly how they want them to. I love the way the drums are a major part of this CD and that there is no set beat on any one of their tracks. The drums actually follow the song in every way possible which is a rarity nowadays, they’re not just chorus drums-verse drums-chorus drums etc.<br><br>The EP itself is very relaxed as the comment at the tail of “Happy Birthday” describes: “I honestly think you want to sit down calmly and take a stress pill and think things over”. Also Rhode Island haven’t overdone it with the bass. They deliver a colossal guitar melody and just simply give it that extra edge with some very gentle syncopated bass, and it works - so why not?<br><br>Track Analysis:<br><br>“Big Two-Hearted River” is probably the most upbeat of the 4 tracks on this EP. With its immediate anthem-like melody and catchy chorus this is a perfect start to the album. Peaking with the very nice improvised acoustic solo toward the end.<br><br>“With Love & Squalor” I would say is the most emotional track on the album. Beginning with a Radiohead-like tune and quickly morphing into a more aggressive yet controlled strumming pattern (i.e. not going and trying to strum as fast a possible to show emotion). With added antiques here and there and very dynamic drumbeats this track definitely says “this is my heart pouring”.<br><br>As “Happy Birthday” commences it is quite clear now that Rhode Island have tried to create something different on each track (and succeeded might I add). You can really tell this by the time you get to this track which has to be, by far, my favourite song on the EP. It begins almost like a cross between one of Bob Marley’s later releases and Hawaiian music, but steadily generates into a Beatles-like melody. Best song in my opinion.<br><br>Finally onto “Ladybird”, without a doubt this is the most relaxed track on the album. The articulated melody combined with fast, chirpy lyrics actually makes you think of a ladybird flying over summer fields (and a happy one at that so it’s all good). I think that it could be a bit longer as it was extremely enjoyable and I didn’t really want it to stop. I guess it’s harder to get bored of then (not that that will happen at all with this EP).<br><br>All in all this has to be the best EP that I have been sent so far and it is going to take an awful lot to top it, as it’s not far off perfect. Rhode Island have a unique style and wide array of musical talents that will get them far.<br><br>If this music was a person it would be: the nicest person you have ever met. Who gives so much to others yet takes so little. Who is never mean and always happy.</p>
