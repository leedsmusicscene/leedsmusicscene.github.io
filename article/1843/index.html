    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for Sawthroat.</p>
    <p>Karl - vocals / guitar; Ste - bass; Ant - drums; Woody - lead guitar<br><br>In 1997, the foundations of what has now become Sawthroat, were laid. Karl and Ste, after being inspired by the passion and excitement of live music, decided they wanted to make others feel as they did when watching bands at venues in and around Leeds. With this in mind, the band formed and began experimenting with various musical styles, ideas and member line-ups, gigging along the way. The one thing that has always remained the same is that every song has drawn inspiration through life experience, whether it be through the lyrics or in musical expression.<br><br>In 2003, with the addition of Ant and Woody, Sawthroat have become an exciting band within the Leeds music scene. Captivating audiences in major venues up and down the country with their unique blend of rock, folk, funk, grunge, and indie, their music is thought provoking, accessible, dynamic and confident.<br><br>Never a band to disappoint, Sawthroat always put on an exciting and spontaneous live show.<br><br>Sawthroatâ€™s rule of playing hard and practicing even harder means they are well on their way to achieving their goal of musical domination!.</p>
