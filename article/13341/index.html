        <h1>El Cartel to put on Cancer Research benefit on Briggate</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2010.</p>
    <p>On Saturday 25th September 2010, local Leeds band El Cartel will be performing live on Briggate, Leeds city centre in aid of Cancer Research. The band are part of a national campaign 'Busking for Cancer' which asks local musicians around the country to get out on the streets and play for the public with all proceeds collected on the day going to Cancer Research. <br /><br />With the full support of Leeds City Council for the campaign, they have snagged a prime location in one of the countries most energetic and happening cities. The band is positive that the exposure and spectacle will create an interest for the independent band and generate much needed donations to their supported charity. <br /><br />El Cartel are regulars on the Leeds gig circuit and have enjoyed BBC radio success with their catchy, unique blend of summer indie sounds with funky disco beats. They will be joined by some of the other Leeds upcoming talent that are regularly performing on the Leeds circuit, with thanks to Fusion Now Promotions. <br /><br />The band are confident that there will be a good turn out and passing interest to hear local Leeds bands, support the essential work of Cancer Research and local musicians who need the public to get behind them and help them get their music to the masses in Leeds and beyond!<br /><br />Harry Kendall, bassist with El Cartel said "We were thinking of ideas to promote the band and had always wanted to play an outdoor gig. When the opportunity to be involved with 'Busking for cancer' came along we decided we wanted to support the charity and are working hard to put on a good show in one of the city's busiest streets. We're very excited and hope we can raise a good amount for cancer research."<br /><br />There will be free CDs, goodie bags and balloons for all donations (while stocks last), so get down to Briggate on the 25th September 2010 to watch local performers 'busking for cancer' and help Cancer research continue with their goals of research, information and support for patients, families and anyone affected by cancer.</p>
