    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for Honest Thief.</p>
    <p>The band began life in Middlesbrough, where Graeme and Baz are from and has gone through many line up changes throughout its existence, orginally called Circle they were quite prominent in their fair old town. However they were dragged away and settled in Leeds, where they met Sam and Hazey, thus Honest Thief was born. The line up consisted of these four and the search for a drummer began, this took an extremely long time, drummers came and went but none could handle the ferocity of the band... Until a young scotsman who goes by the name of Jamie was lost in Leeds and needed directions... Some say its fate, I say its providence. He was taken on board as the fifth and final member of the band. In its current incarnation you will be dazzled and amazed..</p>
