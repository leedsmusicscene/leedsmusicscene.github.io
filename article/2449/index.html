        <h1>Loudmouth Soup - Skydiver / Narcolepsy</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Skydiver / Narcolepsy" recorded by Loudmouth Soup. The review was written by Sam Saunders in 2004.</p>
    <p>Loudmouth Soup have long memories and some skill in their five-piece band. Here are two catchy pop songs of some quality. "Skydiver" is simple, bouncy and poppy with a nagging, slightly nasal chorus. "Narcolepsy" spreads itself more, with pedal steel, piano and various country-rock licks from the Rolling Stones' "Wild Horses" and "Angie" side of things. Ben Hall's vocal style certainly has some Mick Jagger intonation, and the band play together like comfortable jeans, t-shirt and leather jacket. I can see this stuff going down well in all sorts of places - but probably not among the 14-25 year olds whose birthright includes the absolute privilege of not having to respect anything simply because itâ€™s good or skilfully made. The Coral, or one of their dodgy Liverpool acolytes, might have made this sparkle, crumble and fall apart in a much more contemporary way. Banjo, it has to be said, needs to work hard to be cool. With good songs and quality playing, Loudmouth Soup are a promising live prospect.</p>
