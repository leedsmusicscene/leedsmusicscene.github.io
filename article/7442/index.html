    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for Flatt Tin Roof.</p>
    <p>After a chance meeting during the early years, J and Adie met Colin. It was during the days of snap and vanilla ice, they decided to make a stand against 90s music! Picking up instruments during high school, practising in a dark bedroom in a Rothwell villa, raised on a combination of Therapy? Pink Floyd, MC Hammer and Rage against the machine they made their stand, with a little help from J's cousin Daz filling in on bass<br /><br />However, then disaster took hold, and the band collapsed. Outside influences tore the band apart and the world believed it had lost one of its most promising talents.. But then...<br /><br />2005 Arrived. More than 5 years after putting down their instruments, in a chance meeting in the sort of concert pit you'd expect the law to ban J, Adie and Colin decided to put the band back together. A one off wedding gig ensued under the name "Hot Tin Roof" where J's beloved wife and talented singer Louise appeared on vocals and Adie swapped his guitar for Bass. With a new found hunger for music, J, Adie and Colin formed the now Flatt Tin Roof and once more made their stand. Musically more mature,professional and aware than their humble beginnings.<br /><br />Can the band wagon's engine last to the end of the road? Or will they collapse once more under explosive circumstances? It'll be one hell of a ride, so stay tuned the website and future gigs to find out.<br /><br />Currently, Flatt Tin Roof have just put together their first demo and are playing a few gigs in the West Yorkshire area. Whether they up and chase after the world Or stay true to their Yorkshire roots is unknown. One thing that's for sure is, Flatt Tin Roof are back, and better than ever!.</p>
