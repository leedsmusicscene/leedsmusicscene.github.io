    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Are You Happy?!" recorded by Shakinouts. The review was written by Rachel Gardner in 2009.</p>
    <p>Since the formation of Shakinouts in 2007 the band have clocked up an impressive historic gig list and caused waves in the Leeds music scene. With a slot supporting Shed Seven in December things are certainly looking good for this band.<br /><br />Shakinouts offer a bouncy and truly enjoyable single with 'Are You Happy!?' The vocals have a beautifully textured quality and a bittersweet chorus you can't fail to sing along to. On the down side, the track is too long; it fails to develop quickly enough leaving the track flat. The production is clever and sharp giving the song a richness slightly missing from the B side 'Fail You Now,' which has a feel of 'Ever Fallen In Love With Someone (You Shouldn't've)' by 'The Buzzcocks.'<br /><br />'Are You Happy!?' is well crafted and will leave you with a warm fuzzy feeling in your toes.</p>
