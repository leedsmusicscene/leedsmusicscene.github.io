    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2015.</p>
    <p>Following last week's announcement of fifty more bands added to Live At Leeds 2015 the festival organisers have today revealed that The Cribs will be their headliner this coming May.<br /><br />With their forthcoming sixth album 'For All My Sisters' due this month, The Cribs have consistently pushed the boundaries of indie music and Live At Leeds have today declared "their attitude befits the festival perfectly". <br /><br />Gary Jarman said, "We are really looking forward to headlining Live at Leeds. It's cool because Leeds has always embraced us, and so to be asked to play our 'comeback' show headlining the festival is something that we are really looking forward to."<br /><br />Other additions to the Live at Leeds 2015 today were Rolo Tomassi, Amy Studt, Charlie Hole, Dan Owen, Elderbrook, Fossa, Johnny O'Donnell, Jonny Quits, Rupert Stroud, Samuel S Parkes, Sophie Jamieson, The Vryll Society and Whilk and Misky. <br /><br />Live At Leeds 2015 takes place on Saturday 2nd May with over two hundred bands across twenty stages and many Leeds music venues, all accessed through a single wristband. <br /><br />Tickets can be purchased for Â£27.50 through Leeds Gig Tickets and are exchanged for a wristband on the day of the event. Also look out for the special offer of a festival ticket and a copy of The Cribs new album.</p>
