    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for Susskind.</p>
    <p>Susskind, from Keighley near Bradford, specialising in their own brand of heavy rock, have been compared to Pearl Jam, Audioslave and 'early Nickleback'. Some Metallica influences can be heard and their sound is meaty yet melodic.  The lads are writing new material all the time and being conscious of the constant unimaginative rubbish that is put out there, they try to keep it close to their hearts and different from everything else. <br />
<br />
The band are gaining serious recognition locally, and have won second place in the recent Keighley Musician's Centre Battle of the Bands 2006, with their vocalist Ben Cook securing the best vocalist prize, beating some serious competition to do so. <br />
<br />
With a couple of line-up changes under their belts they have tightened their show immensely and are a talent to be reckoned with. Paul Evans (lead guitar) is the most recent addition to the band, and joins Gavin Musto on guitar, Mick Spencer on bass and Matt Rose on drums. <br />
<br />
The band have just finished recording live favourite "Cerebral Static" and will be adding to their studio work over the next couple of months. Check out their gigs page on www.susskind.co.uk/gigs for their latest live shows. Make sure you know what the fuss is about - come to one of their shows and rock it hard!!.</p>
