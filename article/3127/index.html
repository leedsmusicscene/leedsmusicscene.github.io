    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for Meltwire.</p>
    <p>We got together roughly three years ago in a small inbred town just north of Shrewsbury. It was only after a couple of years that we started to take the band seriously and started supporting some of our favourite bands like Serafin, Jetplane Landing and Queen Adreena. In 2003 we received label interest and played our largest show to date, opening a sold out Wulfrun hall to 2,000 people supporting Skindred. So far in 2004 we have tried to play as much as possible, including supports with Minus and a festival appearance with Million Dead. We also won a Beacon FM battle of the bands event in the West Midlands showground. Our top moment of the year has to be opening for our heroes Biffy Clyro at the Wulfrun hall in Wolverhampton. They loved us even dedicating a song to us saying "Meltwire fucking rocked!"<br><br>We now have shifted operations to Leeds because Thom and Jon haved started Uni, so we hope to play as much as we can here. .</p>
