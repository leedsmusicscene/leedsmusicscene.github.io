The five songs making up 'Time Will Tell' - 'Love Of You', 'Spinning Tops', 'Black Albatross', 'Question Every Day', and 'Exposition' - form a cohesive whole, almost as if this were a concept record or the musical component of a larger performance piece.'  The Impaler Speaks on Time Will Tell - see the full review here<br /><br />'If you've seen them live then you'll already know how great they are but for those not afforded the pleasure well, you're in for a treat. Lush complex arrangements that mix up indie/rock/pop influences into a hook-laden, well crafted 7 tracker. Add to that Claire's heavenly vocals and you've got a winner for sure.' Jumbo Records on 'Time Will Tell'<br /><br />'Cameron's beautiful, haunting, candid vocals that travel on dreamlike keyboard parts simply demand to be heard.' A Musical Priority<br /><br />'With influences ranging from Beyonce to Led Zeppelin, there is most definitely something for everyone in Claire Cameron Band's music, and I suggest if they are playing a gig near you, you go and check them out!' Chelle's Rock Blog<br /><br />'More than just a rock group, more a way of life..' Borin Van Loon<br /><br />'The music of Claire Cameron Band takes a cross section of almost every genre imaginable and flits between them in a surprisingly cohesive manner' No Title Magazine<br /><br />'Musicians in Leeds, it seems, cannot be easily categorized, processed, or rubber-stamped as 'this' or 'that' or 'the other'. Leeds is a culturally diverse city, and Leeds-based artists are nothing if not diverse.'<br />The Impaler Speaks<br /><br /><br />'Time Will Tell' is now on sale in Jumbo Records, Crash Records, iTunes, Spotify, Amazon UK, CDBaby and more!</p>
