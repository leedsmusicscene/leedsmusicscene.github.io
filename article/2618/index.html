    <p class="lead">This is a review of "s/t" recorded by TMF. The review was written by Gavin Miller in 2004.</p>
    <p>When you're young, some things don't seem to matter. Mortgages, pensions, buying a car, etc. seem to be a million miles away when you're in your teens. So when this CD is playing, I get the feeling that these guys won't really care that much about what I say, so I'll just say it.<br><br>The production values on this are, understandably, fucking awful. The instruments don't seem to mix together, there are no effects on <i>anything</i> (not even compression, or other essential mixing techniques) and the voice sounds like a 12-year-old singing in his bedroom. The CD itself constantly skips, has annoying blips and gaps in the tracks, and you get the feeling this CD was burned on Nero using 58x speed or something.<br><br>With titles like 'Rich The Roadie' and 'Looking Out The Window', it's easy to see that in the field of song writing, they don't stray too far from the pop punk of say, Blink 182 or even Sum 41. That said, the punk energy and the careless abandon are evident; and while making a CD probably wasn't the best idea in the world, I'm sure they can work on and build up their songs. So that next time, when they are ready, it'll sound a hell of a lot better than this.<br><br>This probably would've killed in 1977, due to it's DIY spirit. But unfortunately for them, it's 2004. </p>
