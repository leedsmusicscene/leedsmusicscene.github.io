    <p>Steven Jackson - Singer<br>Adam Lunn - Guitar/Backing Vocals<br>Andrew Lunn - Guitar<br>Richard Sykes - Bass Guitar<br>Mark Hesford - Drums<br><br>Based in Huddersfield, Nova were founded in the year 2000 when most of them were still either in college or at high school. The original line-up being very different from the current one, only Adam and his brother Andrew still remain. Nova have been gigging and recording in the last 5 years, during which they have recorded 5 demos, Nova 4 being the latest one. Their first demo also made it onto Steve Lamacq’s Onemusic site. During the demos they’ve increasingly started to experiment with their sound, up to the point where Adam has started to produce the songs himself.<br>The current line-up came about when members of Nova met at university, singer Steven Jackson, bassist Richard Sykes and drummer Mark Hesford all go to Huddersfield Uni. Nova have been playing all over the country in the last couple of years including the Roadhouse in Manchester, the Cockpit in Leeds (4 times!!!), Joseph’s Well also in Leeds, the Garage and the Bull & Gate in London, the Boardwalk in Sheffield and Junction 7 in Nottingham. They were also reviewed by BBC radio Nottingham and BBC Leeds. They’ve also been playing a lot in their native Huddersfield trying to build up their local following..</p>
