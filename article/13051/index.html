    <p>Ryan Cooke - Vocals, Guitar, Saw<br />Dave Hill - Vocals, Guitar, Harmonica, Cello<br />Winterbird Footfeet - Lead Guitar, Glockenspiel<br />Matt Stephenson - Clarinet, Backing Vocals<br />Alex Papaioannou - Bass, Backing Vocals<br />Warren Timmis - Drums, Glockenspiel, Violin, Lead Guitar<br />Angeline Bjerregaard - Piano, Violin, Backing Vocals<br /><br />Heart-Ships are a Leeds based band, playing together since December 2009. One day, disillusioned after several half assed attempts to form bands proper, Ryan and Winterbird made a pledge to one another that they'd jam the most lawless, anything goes music they could come up with until something happened. Dave soon joined to make their acoustic venture a three piece and many an evening of 2009 was frittered and screamed away in various dank Leeds basements. Inevitably, the sound expanded and Matt, Warren, Alex and Angeline joined to lend their wonderful musicianship to help tame and harness the sound - While helping realise the grander potential of the songs. The first demos were recorded at Cannonball Studios, Leeds (April 2010) - But these are just the beginning. A small mountain of songs (in varying stages of labor) are burning in the blood, hearts and minds of Heart Ships, and can be heard in their electrifying live set..</p>
