    <p>Live at Leeds 2010 was officially launched this week and the festival is now back for its fourth year with event organisers Futuresound promising that the event in 2010 will be the best year for the festival yet.<br /><br />And to coincide with the launch the organisers have announced that the first headline act to be revealed is our "Band of the Year" Wild Beasts.<br /><br />The Live at Leeds event began in 2007 as part of Leeds' 800th birthday celebrations and after three sell-out years the now annual music festival is expanding further still.<br /><br />This year the event is set to operate across 17 venues throughout the Leeds City Centre and that's a whole eight more stages than last year.<br /><br />The increased scale of the event means that there will be more tickets available this year and over 150 bands will be playing on the Saturday. As a result of the expansion Leeds city centre is expecting to welcome 7,500 music fans over the day.<br /><br />The main venues include The Cockpit, Leeds Metropolitan University, The Faversham, The Well and Brudenell Social Club.<br /><br />Added venues for 2010 include Nation of Shopkeepers, Leeds University (Stylus, Refectory and Mine), Leeds College of Music and The Wardrobe.<br /><br />This year the festival will run from Friday 30th April through to Sunday 2nd May and will feature a large programme of live gigs and musically inspired events.<br /><br />As usual there will be a series of high profile ticketed gigs throughout the weekend, commencing on the Friday night with an informal conference-style event hosted by Leeds Metropolitan University.<br /><br />To round up the festival, on Sunday, Live at Leeds hosts The Hangover - an industry panel, seminar and networking event which gives anyone that has questions about breaking into or working in the music industry a chance to have their questions answered. Last year the event was panelled by professionals from Universal, PRS, Coda, X-Ray and record label Dance to the Radio who provided useful advice for both musicians and enthusiasts alike.<br /><br />Tickets (exchangeable for a Live at Leeds wristband) for the Saturday are available now through Leeds Gig Tickets for £15.</p>
