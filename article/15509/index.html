    <p>Vocals : Ed Black <br />Rhythm Guitar : Ewan Colson<br />Lead Guitar : Elliot Lloyd English<br />Drums: Barney Lister<br />Bass: Tom Collier<br /><br />In April 2010, at the ages of just 15 and 16, Hot Against The Cold played their first live gig at the 'Crickstock Festival' in West Yorkshire. Since then they have gone from strength to strength, culminating in December with a fantastic show at the Picturedrome, Holmfirth, A classic venue which has seen performances from the likes of 'The Charlatans', 'Newton Faulker', 'John Mayall' and many more true rock artists.<br /><br />In November 2010 the band recorded their first demo CD consisting of four of their most popular tracks written by themselves. After impressive sales at a local level they are now set to record their second CD in July 2011 after a wave of writing, resulting in the creation of some awesome new songs that will take Hot Against The Cold to a new level.<br /><br />Young, wild, and most of all, truly talented these boys are determined and exited to take their music to new heights. Without a doubt they are a band to listen to, and most definitely one to watch. Real Music is back..</p>
