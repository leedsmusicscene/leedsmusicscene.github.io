    <p>Five piece folk rock band The Sailmakers release their debut EP 'Creaking Ships and Midnight Whiskey' on Monday 26th March with a launch party at the 360 Club at The Library in Leeds on Friday 30th.<br /><br />The five-piece spent the last 6 months creating and recording the EP, which will be available from iTunes, Spotify, Crash Records and Jumbo Records.<br /><br />Exclusive limited packages will also be available at 360 Club for Â£5. With every special EP purchased on Friday the buyer will receive a free t-Shirt, sticker and badge.<br /><br />Earlier this year The Sailmakers were picked to play as part of 360 Live, in association with BBC Introducing. This saw the band broadcast live on the BBC radio network and streamed live on the big screens in Millennium Square and Centenary Square (Bradford).<br /> <br />The band's sound is heavy folk, with lush rhythms and playful lyrics, and their weaving guitars and rolling bass-lines create warm textures and imagery with the music.<br /><br />Richard Watson, promoter of 360 Club, said, "The Sailmakers are fantastic [and] they completely smashed it during the live broadcast back in February."</p>
