    <p>Bradford Council have confirmed six more bands for this year's Bingley Music Live.<br /><br />Theme Park, The Dunwells, The Dirty Rivers, KatMen, Dave McPherson and China Rats will join the bill for the seventh annual festival, which will be held at Myrtle Park in Bingley between Friday, 30th August and Sunday, 1st September. <br />  <br />The up-and-coming acts will appear alongside the previously announced Primal Scream, The Cribs, The Human League, CHIC featuring Nile Rodgers, The Wonder Stuff, The Fratellis, Lucy Spraggan, Charlie Brown, The Lake Poets, The Temperance Movement, Loveable Rogues, Summer Camp, The Struts, The Electric Swing Circus, Natasha Haws, Rose and the Howling North, and Holy Moly and the Crackers. <br /> <br />Theme Park have been hailed as the worthy successors to the funk-rock mantle previously held by Vampire Weekend and Talking Heads. The London outfit, who have toured with their Bingley Music Live compatriots Summer Camp, released their self titled debut album earlier this year.<br /><br />The Dunwells are a vintage folk rock band from Leeds who have built up a strong local following since forming in 2009. The five-piece were named HMV's Next Big Thing of 2012 and featured as Caffe Nero's Artist of the Month in November 2010. Compared to Crosby, Stills and Nash, and Mumford & Sons, they released their debut album last year.<br /><br />The Dirty Rivers mine a seam of classic rock influences and are a little bit Oasis, a soupçon Arctic Monkeys, and a lot Black Rebel Motorcycle Club. The Liverpool outfit released 'Black Heart / Filth'earlier this year, with previous single 'Get Your Guns Out' being played on radio stations such as Xfm, BBC 6Music and Absolute Radio.<br /><br />KatMen are a rockabilly band formed in 2007 by former Stray Cats drummer Slim Jim Phantom and Imelda May guitar slinger Darrel Higham. The American-British outfit have released two albums that mix covers with original material in the classic rock 'n' roll tradition. <br /> <br />Dave McPherson is a singer-songwriter from Brentwood who first tasted success as frontman of alternative rock band InMe. He has since carved out a career as a solo artist, with his folk influenced material being described as somewhere between James Blunt and Roger Chapman. <br /> <br />China Rats are a quartet from Leeds that have been inspired by a love of punk, 50's pop and classic British guitar bands. They have been championed by Alan Raw (BBC Introducing in West Yorkshire), Huw Stevens (BBC Radio 1) and Tom Robinson (BBC 6Music). <br />  <br />Councillor Andrew Thornton, Bradford Council's Executive Member responsible for Leisure, said: "The line up for this year's Bingley Music Live is an exciting combination of established acts and up and coming talent. It is going to be a fantastic event and will build on its reputation for being a festival with a big heart and big sounds." <br /><br />Three-day weekend tickets are on sale via Yorkshire Gig Tickets.</p>
