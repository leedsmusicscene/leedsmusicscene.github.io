    <p>With their 2012 EP racking up gigs nationwide, and over 13,000 youtube hits, the Leeds based five-piece are launching their new single on Saturday 20th July<br /><br />After the success of 2012s 'Words Of A Fool' EP, Feeds toured the country across the summer, with the highlight of playing alongside Ash at Galtres Festival, amongst other festival appearances. Their single 'SleepyHead', in particular, gained praise from the likes of Alan Raw (BBC Introducing), producer David McEwan (Plan B) and composer Nitin Sawhney.<br /><br />2013 began with the band entering their rehearsal/writing space in rural Ilkley, before hitting the studio with acclaimed producer James Mottershead (British Sea Power, Lake Poets) to begin work on their new EP. With the recording process finely balanced between high end recording studios (The Chairworks, Beat Streat) and intimate home environments, this gave Feeds the time to explore new musical territory.<br /><br />The first glimpse from this carefully crafted process is 'Beware Believe' - an infectious, upbeat single that perfectly showcases the band's catchy melodies, tight rhythm section and impressive vocal harmonies. Feeds' subtle use of time-signature changes demonstrates their obsessive attention to detail, as well as their outright musicianship, something always noted upon in live reviews. The song will be available to download for free from www.wearefeeds.bandcamp.com on Saturday 20th July.<br /><br />Feeds will be celebrating the launch of their single, 'Beware Believe', by performing @ 360 Club, The Library (Leeds) on Saturday 20th July. Tickets, Â£5, are available at Crash and Jumbo records.<br /><br />Upcoming Dates:<br />Sat 20th July - Single Launch - 360 Club, The Library Pub, Leeds <br />Friday 26th July - The Manor, Horsforth<br />Sunday 11th August - Ilkley Summer Festival<br />Saturday 17th August - Tribfest, Driffield</p>
