        <h1>Beautiful Feet - Headstrong</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Headstrong" recorded by Beautiful Feet. The review was written by Richard Garnett in 2005.</p>
    <p>Beautiful Feet must have been rubbing their hands together with the recent success of bands like Keane and the dreary Thirteen Senses. However they certainly can't be accused of being opportunists, having been plying their trade in these parts for the past 4 years or so.<bR><br>Headstrong is a pretty sounding tune but that is all, and it's not a patch on previous release Weightless. It's atmospheric, sung with meaning, it even opens with a single chiming piano, but it never reaches a fitting crescendo. Keane with the addition of some rather ordinary female backing vocals doesn't exactly inspire. The bizarre choice of a 60's cop show sound effect for the keyboards adds little to the ironically titled b-side Masterpiece.<bR><br>It should not be a reflection on an excellent band, who with other releases have already proved their worth. On this occasion however, they've simply missed the mark.</p>
