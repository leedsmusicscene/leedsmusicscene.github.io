    <p>After a successful start to 2013 - with critically acclaimed performances at Live At Leeds, supporting Public Service Broadcasting, and BBC radio airplay - Happy Daggers are set to release their new single: 'Get Yourself Together', on Saturday 20th July.<br /><br />Following positive responses to the April release of their 4 track EP, 'Reverse///Rewind' and two months of well received gigs, Happy Daggers have spent June recording their next single: 'Get Yourself Together'. The track was recorded at Loom Studios, in Leeds, by veteran music producer Grant Henderson (The Dunwells, In Echoes) using a real mixture of modern production techniques and vintage equipment.<br /><br />This session's success was summed up by Tommi (drums), who said: 'It's been great to work with somebody who really gets what we're trying to do musically, and knows how to get the best out of us. We're really happy with this track.'<br /><br />The result of these recordings is a hybrid track that successfully references its influences, while still managing to feel fresh. 'Get Yourself Together' is a contagious single that will undoubtedly get people moving. Utilising their thumping, yet funky, rhythm section, lively guitars, and disco-soul drenched vocals Happy Daggers' have set out to further develop their sound, and give music listeners something to really engage with.<br /><br />'Get Yourself Together' will be released via major digital stores, and selected local outlets, on Saturday 20th July. To celebrate the release of this single, Happy Daggers will be having a single launch event at 360 Club, in Leeds, on the same day (The Library Pub, Leeds. Tickets (Â£5) available from Jumbo records and Crash records).</p>
