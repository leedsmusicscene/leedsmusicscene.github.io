    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for The Listeners.</p>
    <p>Emma Thorpe provides the main voice, a velvet glove softening the punch, delivering The Listeners songs with, in turn, uncompromising invective and heart on sleeve insight. Robert Cook's dark baritone voice and explosive guitar lines complete The Listeners emotive sound.<br /><br /><br /><br />"the listeners were f**king brilliant i really enjoyed last night !"<br /><br />RICHARD HAWLEY<br /><br />"Alternately gentle and dramatic....like PJ Harvey pissed off, unplugged and wearing a kaftan."¬ù<br /><br />MUSIC MART MAGAZINE<br /><br />"Its an impressive release and one where my favorite track seems to change the more i listen to it"<br />"Im further impressed when we go upstairs to see them perform. They sing around eight songs, and the audience loves them. The sweetness and clarity of Emmas voice is complemented by Robs guitar and vocal contributions, And they do write some great songs, which i really enjoyed hearing performed live"<br /><br />SANDMAN MAGAZINE<br /><br />" Combining earthy but sophisticated guitar lines and minimal drums, the female vocal alternately coaxes and powers the songs through, whilst the occasional male vocal provides a darker undertow. The acoustic guitars chime, strum, slide and float lyrically; constructed in layers these songs often work from quiet beginnings and build into passionate ballads, the lyrics belying a world-weary yet still fiery attitude."<br /><br />SANDMAN MAGAZINE<br /><br />"Experienced on the Northern circuit, The Listener's are something special indeed. Caressing the airwaves with a voice like velvet, singer Emma Thorpe's uncompromising emotive insight, coupled with the dark guitar and baritone stylings of Robert Cook, make this twosome a match made in heaven."<br /><br />THE PLUG<br /><br />"They only got here a month since and, presumably in some unified subversion of your Gatecrashers and your Oceanas, the students have already infiltrated the usually serene Johnson Arms. Then again, the bands didn't help much either - slinking onstage, Sheffield's two man (well, a man and a woman) folk-blues outfit The Listeners proceed to dish out more destruction to the quiet indie pub atmosphere than a week's worth of tipsy Freshers could ever muster. At their loudest, guitarist Robert's knife-edge guitar lines and singer Emma's sultry musings combine to create a thrilling prospect, the chalk-and-cheese likes to which, if it weren't for these, you'd likely only lay witness should Howling Bells bring Nico back from the grave for an autumn night's campfire singalong, while their hushed mid-set tracks recall "Ocean of Noise" Arcade Fire. Stirring stuff, then."<br /><br />THIS CITY.</p>
