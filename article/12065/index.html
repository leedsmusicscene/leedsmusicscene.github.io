The band Formed in May 2007 in Toronto, Canada and is now located in Leeds, UK. Their sound is best described as 'Progressive, Aggressive, Rock' Influenced by acts such as AC/DC, Motley Crue, Muse, & Rise Against.<br /><br />    The band sum themselves up best in their own words "We're not only passionate for the music we create but the music industry as a whole. We believe in producing music that is honest and energetic and also believe in having the business mind and organization to back it" - In today's industry sitting back waiting for a record deal while practicing in the parents garage just aint enough. Getting out there and making a name for yourself is what it takes. And that's exactly what Cities Between Us are doing!.</p>
