    <p>Leeds-based Jupiter Falls took the number one spot in the Ultimate Top 50 Countdown of 2013 on Love Leeds Radio. It was a very tough contest with some truly amazing bands and artists but the Leeds outfit became the clear winner.<br /><br />Spokesman for Love Leeds Radio 'Mark Taylor' recently said about the band:<br /><br />"Every once in a while working in this industry you get the chance to discover a band who have that something extra, that quality which makes them shine above all the rest; incredible musicians, powerful vocals, awesome and original tracks. <br /><br />Jupiter Falls is one such band and I feel the word awesome fails to do these guys justice."<br /><br />He went onto say about their début album Revolution:<br /><br />"Jupiter Falls début album Revolution is five young talented lads combining their collective skills to bring you an album so unexpected, so immense that you are left in awe as to the power of the beast. If you intend on buying one more album this year, buy Revolution - This is music at its very best. Simply Amazing."<br /><br />Lead singer from the band James Hart wanted to say: "It's been a great end to a great year. Thanks for listening and liking our music and we will see you on the road in 2014"<br /><br />So congratulations to Jupiter Falls for being crowned Love Leeds Radio Band of the Year 2013.</p>
