        <h1>Leeds musicians raise money for Children In Need</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2011.</p>
    <p>A number of Leeds musicians came together in aid of Children In Need last Friday with the 'Great Musical Bake Off' raising a total of £592.74.<br /><br />At 11am Claire Cameron Band set up at Out of The Woods on Water Lane to serenade customers as they came in for their morning coffee. It went down well with people giving generously for their musical accompaniment to their coffee break.<br /><br />Miranda Versus The Crok then sang a rousing punk folk solo set before the musicians moved to Out of The Woods at Granary Wharf and then on to The Midnight Bell in time for an evening fundraiser.<br /><br />While the stage was being set up for the fundraiser, the cakes and baked goods began to arrive with contributions from Fancie Cupcakes, Brown & Blond and Fayre by Alley.<br /><br />The day's musical entertainment continued at 6pm with March of Dimes, acoustic sets from Claire Cameron Band and Miranda Versus The Crok, and a headlining set from Tag Team Preacher.<br /><br />With barely any cakes or baked goodies left, a sold out raffle and an empty keg of Pudsey Beer (donated by The Leeds Brewery), the 'Great Musical Bake Off' was a resounding success and raised a grand total of £592.74 for Children In Need.<br /><br />A great effort from all those involved.</p>
