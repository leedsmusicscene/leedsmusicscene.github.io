        <h1>Arthur Rigby & The Baskervylles named as Alan Raw's band of Leeds Festival</h1>

    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2011.</p>
    <p>Arthur Rigby & The Baskervylles have been the name on a lot of lips this summer. When the news broke that AR were to play Leeds and Reading Festivals on the BBC Introducing Stage through the Futuresound competition, the only people who seemed a bit miffed were BBC Introducing in West Yorkshire as they had wanted to announce the band themselves.<br /><br />BBC Introducing West Yorkshire presenter and festival compare Alan Raw said on his show that Arthur Rigby were "the band of the festival" and judging by the reaction from the near 500 people who were watching, AR left many people impressed. <br /><br />Singer and guitarist Ben said of the experience: "It's one of those things that doesn't come along for many bands at our stage. If nothing comes of the big plan we have for this band then we can look back at experiences like this and say it was well worth it." <br /><br />If you head to www.arthurrigby.co.uk, there is a fantastic video documenting the band's time at both festivals, and here live at 360 Club.<br /><br />BBC 6 Music's Tom Robinson, long time fan of the band, has been playing tracks from the set at Leeds Festival on his Introducing show, as has Alan Raw, declaring Arthur Rigby & The Baskervylles as "a brilliant live band".<br /><br />Arthur Rigby's most recent single, White Houses, has sold out in physical format and continues to receive rave reviews and airplay across 6 Music and BBC Leeds and can be found - http://arthurrigby.bandcamp.com<br /><br />Arthur Rigby & the Baskervylles play 360 Club Friday 23rd September.</p>
