From intimate acoustic sets in front of open fires in rural pubs, to festivals in cow sheds in front of people in wellies and samba climaxing loud, brash sets in bars across England.  <br /><br />Their Falling Down single has been played as the MP3 of the week on BBC Radio Leeds (who described it as 'Brilliant').  They have supported Teddy Thompson at Joseph's Well in Leeds and played to rapt audiences at the Cavern club in Liverpool and the Courthouse in Otley.<br /><br />The Redwood Thinkers are currently putting the finishing touches to their new fan sponsored album 'Fade So Simple' which is due for release in the new year.<br /><br />Redwood Thinkers are:<br />Darran Cummings - Guitar/vocals <br />Andrew Wright - Guitars/vocals/harmonica <br />Ruth Wilde - Electric/double Bass <br />Kezia Roberts - Vocals/percussion/keyboards<br />Emma Whitehead - Drums.</p>
