        <h1>Jack Afro - Untitled</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Untitled" recorded by Jack Afro. The review was written by Rowan Brunswick in 2008.</p>
    <p>Upon first listen this EP made little impression on me, as ‘Mucktub’ made way for the second track ‘Regular Guy’, I found myself wondering if my CD player was stuck on repeat mode, and had to check that this really was a new song. But in the way that the finest wines improve with age, by the third listen I was hooked on it. It's filled with six nuggets of ridiculously catchy and fidgety angular rock, you'd struggle to find more hooks in a production of Peter Pan played by centipedes, the most obvious being ‘Arguing’, which in between its chorus of “who's in love?” finds time for a doo-wop acapella breakdown the type that Phil Spector might have once written for The Supremes.<br><br>This review would have been more than four stars if the premium quality of the first three songs had been kept up, but things take a bit of a dip at ‘Circles’, which sees the band trying to break away from their mould a bit, and while it’s not short of ideas, they can’t get away with basically messing around with the same basic riff and chord structure. That said, it’s refreshing to see a band messing with their formula properly, something a couple of few well-known Leeds bands disappointingly have failed to do.<br><br>The EP closes with ‘Self Pity’, which is a song which shouldn’t really work, being basically one long extended terrace chant, but they just about pull it off through strength of character. This is a band whose local reputation deserves to be translated into national success.</p>
