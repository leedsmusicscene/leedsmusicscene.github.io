    <p>Carnabells have announced that they have been selected to perform at this year's Glastonbury Festival. The Leeds based rock n' roll quintet will be performing at the festival on the BBC Introducing Stage at 2:30pm on Friday 27th June. <br /><br />"To be offered a slot at Glastonbury is really exciting," said vocalist and rhythm guitarist Luke Thompson. "We've never been to the festival before, so to be performing there on our first time is something that we didn't expect. We're grateful for the opportunity and the support from BBC Introducing. I just hope it doesn't rain too much..." <br /><br />Carnabells were recently confirmed as one of the Futuresound 2014 finalists and will play their heat at The Wardrobe on 11th July. If they win, the band will appear live at the Reading and Leeds Festivals 2014.<br /><br />The band are also set to release a new single, titled 'Call the Sunshine', on 23rd June. You can watch the video below, and the song is also available to download from iTunes and Bandcamp. <br /><br /><iframe width="100%" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/hgWnHNa-H6U" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
