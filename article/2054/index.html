    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for Laika Dog.</p>
    <p>Born in the depths of the moors around Keighley LaikaDog began life in the early 2000's - naming themselves after Laika the first dog in space.<br /><br />Tony (vocals), Paddy (bass) and Sim (guitar) were busy building dry stone walls when they decided that a far warmer pastime would be to form a band and play the songs they had been inspired to write.  Joined by drummer Parry, they began rehearsing and playing gigs to both critical and fan acclaim.<br /><br />A little while down the line and van driver Jay was promoted to keyboad player and the four-piece became five.<br /><br />Playing rock n roll of their own making, they have never diverted from what they see as being the LaikaDog ethic of proper rock played by proper musicians... good tunes included.  <br /><br />Headline dates, festival gigs and a tour supporting Ginger from the Wildhearts have built them a loyal fanbase over the years.  Playing live is what they do best.<br /><br />To date they have released three albums:<br /><br />2005 - Forever and a Day<br />2007 - Mercury<br />2011 - LaikaDog<br /><br />In 2012 Jay moved on to other things and LaikaDog were back to being a four-piece.  <br /><br />They are currently in the process of recording new material for release in the future... check out the facebook page for regular updates about gigs and the like.<br /><br />We leave the last word to Loud-Stuff.com:<br /><br />"There's no question that if you've not heard LaikaDog then you need to, they're a band that are entertaining, professional, and hammer out tracks that, even if you've not heard them before, sound familiar and get you singing along"..</p>
