    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for Hollie Sheard & Friends.</p>
    <p>Hollie Sheard is an original artist from Yorkshire in the North of England. Her gentle, soulful songs have won over fans from all over the UK and even as far as the USA, Australia, and Japan. Back in 2007, when her catalogue of soul and pop ballads became large enough to fill an album, she decided to take them out on the road with a brand new band that become known as Hollie Sheard & Friends. In the hands of a seasoned jazz pianist, a blues guitarist, a funk bassist and a rock drummer, Hollie's music took on an eclectic feel that still characterises it today.<br /><br />Hollie Sheard & Friends have had several successes in the UK Songwriting Contest over the years, with the latest being their Finalist and Runner-Up award in the Jazz/Blues category for 2010.<br /><br />The band are about to follow up their 2008 debut album with a fresh new melting pot of soul, jazz, and blues. The new album is called "By Hook Or By Crook" - because they were determined to complete the album some way, somehow - and is due to be released on Saturday 3rd July 2010 through their website, CD Baby, Amazon, and iTunes.<br /><br />The band's very last gig together in their current form will be the Album Launch on Saturday 3rd July at The Library in Leeds.
