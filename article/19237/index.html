    <p>Exciting times in Leeds as there's a new record label in town and it's about to launch with a 7" singles club.<br /><br />Every month 'Come Play With Me' will release a new 7" featuring two of the most exciting artists from the Leeds city region, with a few surprises thrown in along the way. With a mix of the new and more established across all genres, the label will be demonstrating the awesome diversity of great music coming out from the city.<br /><br />The first split single set for release on 6th November comes from Cinerama and Katie Harkin's new solo outing Harkin.<br /><br />Katie has recently been touring as a member of Sleater-Kinney, as well as also being in Sky Larkin. Listen to the track below. <br /><br /><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/219223824&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe><br /><br />The other side of the single will feature a track from Cinerama. At a special concert at the O2 Academy, Islington on 6th June 2015, the band performed with a string quartet and additional instrumentation and have generously given up the track 'The Girl From The DDR (live)' recorded at that gig for Come Play With Me.<br /><br />David Gedge and Sam Beer-Pearce will be playing a special launch gig at Sheaf Street Studios in Leeds on 24th September to launch the singles club which will also include David Gedge being interviewed live in front of the crowd. Support comes from Post War Glamour Girls and Deadwall.<br /><br />Singles, tickets for the launch event, and associated merchandise for Come Play With Me can be purchased from PledgeMusic.</p>
