    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for Never So Few.</p>
    <p>They say that what doesn't destroy us makes us stronger, and this is certainly the case with Never So Few. Fresh from the spectacular car wreck of something that was never meant to be, guitarist Richard Gibson, bassist John Allison and vocalist Andrew Ibbotson decided to push things forward. A short while later the nascent band was guided towards the talents of drummer Matthew Fisher. The lineup complete, a concentrated burst of intensive songwriting took place, and a sound was honed. A sound that drips with ambition. A sound of such sonic beauty it could be sent from heaven, yet heavy enough to come from hell.
