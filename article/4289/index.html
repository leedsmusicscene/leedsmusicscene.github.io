    <p>Matt Joe Gow grew up in Dunedin, New Zealand, a town on the South Island.  A beautiful town, famous for its independent music scene. He began piano lessons at the age of six and continued through to his teens where piano gave way to guitar.<br><bR>"There had always been a guitar lying around the house and my mother's Beatles records on the stereo, it just seemed natural to pick the thing up and strum along."<br><bR>He started singing and playing in various bands whilst constantly listening to new music from the likes of Jeff Buckley, Radiohead and New Zealand artists such as Neil Finn and Dave Dobbyn.<br><bR>After graduating from University Matt decided to get a round the world ticket heading through Asia, Europe and into North America.  Most evenings were spent playing or writing new material all while trying to develop a sound of his own.<br><bR>After spending three years playing in bars and clubs the world over, Matt was eager to document some of his songwriting.  He formed a band in Vancouver, Canada and set about making his first record.  The band was called Tearlighter and their first EP 'The Truth This Winter' went on to receive national airplay.<br><bR>Following a year of playing shows in Canada the next stop was England where the time had come to record an album of his own.  Matt entered the studio in August 2005 and after one month of intense recording, his first EP, 'Bullet', is a collection of five songs all written within a few weeks of each other.  The sound is raw and in keeping with the live show whilst its lyrical content reflects Matt's time overseas..</p>
