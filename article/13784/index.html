    <p>The Pigeon Detectives have announced their first gig in Leeds for two years. They will appear live at the Cockpit on Monday December 6th to raise urgently needed money for SMILE - The Chloe Tate Foundation.<br /><br />Tickets are on sale at 9am on Saturday 20th November priced at £15. You can buy your tickets online through Luna Tickets.<br /><br />The band said today, "We wanted to get involved in raising money for this cause as Chris and Jenna [founders of SMILE] are both good friends of everyone in the band. The courage they and their family showed through a difficult time and a tragic loss was an inspiration to everyone who knew them. Seeing the dedication, passion and energy they have put into raising awareness for the illness, and also a substantial amount of cash for a baby incubator, has propelled us into wanting to be involved and to help them reach their target of £10,000."<br /><br />If you can't get to the gig you can help SMILE by donating via Just Giving.<br /><br />'SMILE - The Chloe Tate Foundation' was set up to raise awareness of the Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia condition that affects 5,000 babies every year. Their first goal is to raise money for The Peter Cogdon Neonatal Unit at the Leeds General Infirmary.</p>
