    <p class="lead">This article was published in 2014.</p>
    <p>Following on from the critical acclaim Drowned in Sound and Supajam showed for debut EP, 'Creatures of Habit,' Richard Petch announces his second six track EP, 'The Innocent & The Cynic', available from the 25th November on brand new Leeds based label, 'Shadow Basket Records'. <br /><br />The title 'The Innocent & The Cynic,' was born out of a film character's description heard on TV. With this as a starting point Petch walks a line between the two ideas exploring themes of suspicion, betrayal, shame, hope, and openly exploits and celebrates the use of  oxymorons.<br /><br />Mixed by Producer James Kenosha (Dry The River, Lone Wolf, Pulled Apart By Horses); the result is an EP that condenses the sound of his debut  (walls of orchestral arrangements, choral voices, electronic and looped sounds) into concise songs with a band at its core. The EP shows influence from artists such as Bright Eyes and Villagers in the songwriting with Cinematic Orchestra and Patrick Watson in the orchestration and the positivity and tempo of The Shins and Local Natives. The eclecticism and dual personality is held together by his guttural story-telling in his native north-eastern tongue. <br /><br />To celebrate this release, Richard has teamed up with 20mm Productions to create a new music video which can be viewed below:<br /><br /><iframe width="100%" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/fCkLhn6qKG0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
