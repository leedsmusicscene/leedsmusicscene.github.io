        <h1>Seed - Smoke and Mirrors</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Smoke and Mirrors" recorded by Seed. The review was written by Gavin Miller in 2004.</p>
    <p>According to their press release, the three members of Seed are only 16. Blimey. At such a young age, it's fair to say that they have plenty of potential. This 6 track EP is, by first listen, pretty good. Loud, in your face and with some definite production values, it can easily hold its own with some of this new 'post-emo-hardcore' revival that seems to be going on (think Finch, Funeral For A Friend, Brand New, Thursday, etc.)<br><Br>Of course, there are similarities with their contemporaries - the first, and title track sounds like a mix of Kinesis and Funeral For A Friend, with added drums. In fact, most of this EP does its best to sound like FFAF, with its insanely overproduced bass drum sound (sorry, that's the Leeds College of Music in me talking).<br><Br>Second offering 'Trying To Understand Myself' is more of the same - loud, shouty and with plenty of chugging guitar riffage, all wrapped up in some fierce melodies.<br><br>'Make It There' comes off as more Blink 182 than anything else. It's got the vocal harmonies, the guitar melody and the fast drumming (sorry, but this bass drum sound is beginning to piss me off slightly). It's like a window back to <i>my</i> 16-year-old self, complete with Nirvana posters, Blink record in hand and really wanting a girlfriend. Alas, the track's over, and I'm back in 2004. Damn.<br><br>Track 4, 'Why', is more of the same Blink style melodic punk riffage, with typically punk/emo lyrics- "why can't you see/ it's killing me". Hmmm... might wanna work on that lads...<bR><br>'Goes Right On' would be the best track on here, if it wasn't for that bloody bass drum - I defy you to not notice it in this track, it's Lars Ulrich and 'St. Anger' all over again - turn it down! Apart from that, it starts as a nice, down tempo song, complete with the classic 'guitar & delay pedal' combo, before it all kicks off, like emo tracks usually do, with a drum roll and some shouty backing vocals.<bR><Br>'Break It Up', the last track here, is more punk snarl, complete with grizzled vocals, hard guitars and more breakneck drumming.<br><br>All in all, it's not bad. Maybe a bit too familiar, maybe a bit too over-produced, or maybe lacking in diversity, but this lot have potential, that's for sure. Just turn the bass drum down, please...</p>
