    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for Master & The Mule.</p>
    <p>Master & The Mule mutated from the alias of "Immune" around the turn of 2009.<br /><br />As their former they have previously released an EP 'elek' (Gizeh Records) in 2003 and then went on to release debut album, 1/f (Gizeh Records) in 2005. Both releases found critical acclaim and subsequent shows and tours followed with the likes of Pelican, Oceansize, Textures and Aerogramme.<br /><br />After setting up in a new studio space in the bands hometown of Leeds in 2007 the 4 piece went back to basics and set about producing new material. Although musically Master & The Mule does not differ unrecognisably from that of Immune, the feelings within the band were that the new raw and concise approach to their music required a different title under which to present it.<br /><br />Master & The Mule's music in basic terms is usually dark, heavy, slightly unusual guitar based music. A few odd time signatures are often the foundation, Vocals and various noises of synthetic or organic source usually make up the rest.<br /><br />Having parted with Gizeh after the release of 1/f  the band are now in the process of self releasing a wealth of new material over the coming months and shows are planned for the end of 2010..</p>
