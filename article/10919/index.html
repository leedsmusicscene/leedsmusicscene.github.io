    <p class="lead">This is an archive of the band profile for Valleys.</p>
    <p>Formed officially in January 2009, Headingley based 'Valleys' began writing indie-pop songs and rehearsing several upbeat covers to entertain fellow university students at open mic nights and university halls. Their sound, because of the intention to incorporate quirky, unorthodox hooks, developed into an experimental stab at alternative/electro pop. Each piece of previous material was consecutively scrapped each time another electronica-filled song was written;  a handful of the surviving songs made it onto Valley's debut E.P 'Ghost', which was recorded at The Grain Division Studio in June 2009.<br /><br />The band, who are considering the recruitment of another vocalist, currently consists of the four founding members: Scott Johnson (lead vocals/guitar), Ben Taylor (keyboard/synthesizer), Curtis Blair (drums) and Will Cottam (bass). The live show and recording schedule plans to be as busy as before their summer break, with the first appearance back being at The HIFI Club 23rd September 2009. Valleys plan to return to the studio in at the beginning of 2010 with material of a more experimental and possibly progressive nature..</p>
