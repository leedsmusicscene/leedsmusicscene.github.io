Applications are now invited from bands representing the following genres: Pop, Rock/metal, Ska, Punk, Reggae/dub, Soul, Dance, Blues, and world music.<br><br>The majority of bands selected by The Wakefield Music Collective will be unsigned and come from Wakefield and neighbouring towns with a selection from elsewhere in the Yorkshire area, but signed and international acts are also welcome to apply providing they can demonstrate an active presence in the local live music scene.<Br><Br>Priority will be given to those bands who have not played at the festival in previous years. Bands can apply to play between now and the end of June by either informing of a live gig in the area which they would like a member of the Music Collective to attend and/or by sending a demo and biog to:<Br><Br>C2004 Bands Submissions<br>The Gatehouse<Br>Tootal Street<br>Wakefield WF1 5JN<br><br>More information about the festival itself and the selection process can be found at www.themusiccollective.co.uk.
