        <h1>Kid iD - Broken Little Monkey EP</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Broken Little Monkey EP" recorded by Kid iD. The review was written by Danny Martin in 2005.</p>
    <p>American styley alt-soft-rock-folksy voice boy Ralph Pelleymounter has emerged from the bottomless pit of solo acoustic performers and lends his sultry vocals to the backdrop of a full line up, thus Kid iD are born and henceforth comes this natty little EP.<br><br>“Waiting 4 god” is a lovely song. Yup, lovely. Like Hob Nobs. A delightful bass underbelly which rumbles away. Effortlessly ridden by Pelly's (Can I call him that?) country-ish ramblings, unapologetic guitar melodies and some really competent skins work from percussion kid Joe Clark. Hallelujah.<br><br>“Some lonesome place” breeds familiar shenanigans and bounces along merrily like an 8 year pumped full of mucho E-numbers and turkey twizzlers. Woo and then Mr Will Moore lends a bit more weight to the table (job no. 1 – Kit basher) by breaking out the violin on “The waiters song”. A gorgeous melancholy musical daydream, which sets itself apart on this EP. Great stuff.<br><br>This said it is nothing new and as a debut it doesn’t blaze, embers merely burn along. Akin to a Morris Minor chugging away on a motorway. It's beautiful and well made, but it still just chugs, chugs, chugs. Hell though they can play, and Master Pelleymounter has a wonderful set of lungs on him and a cracking bunch of songs. So don’t “b for bin” them just yet, great things can emerge from plodding along don’t you know.</p>
