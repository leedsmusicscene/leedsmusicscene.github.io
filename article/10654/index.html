        <h1>A Last Concern - What's The Point In Living If You Don't Feel Alive</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "What's The Point In Living If You Don't Feel Alive" recorded by A Last Concern. The review was written by Daniel Powell in 2009.</p>
    <p>Leeds based screamo outfit A Last Concern have returned after a three year hiatus with a new line-up, drastically altered sound and a fresh batch of anthems-in-waiting. This three track EP packs considerable sonic punch for a self produced effort, with a depth and dexterity normally absent in today's identikit screamo scene. Opener 'Don't Power Off, Song Loading' is a shape-shifting beast of a tune, equal parts metalcore bluster and punk rock aggression, kind of like Underoath taking a kicking from The Ghost Of A Thousand, whilst 'Head Held High' mixes a rocking bastard of a riff with some upbeat choruses, managing to raise a fist to both the pit and the dancefloor at the same time. The real treat however comes in the shape of 'Judge Me,' a soaring, melodic paean to sneaky violence, almost like 'Revenge of Shinobi' set to a melodic emo soundtrack.<br /><br />What is refreshing about A Last Concern is their willingness to experiment. Granted, this doesn't always pay off, there are times when (especially with '...Song Loading') the music appears far too chaotic for the production, giving the impression that something is being missed that might not be, were the tracks better produced. It is also worth noting that not all of their ideas work, the occasional out of place riff or forced transition making unwelcome appearances from time to time. A Last Concern are a band that wears their influences on their sleeve, which, for the most part, makes for a very well balanced listen. Too often bands are guilty of hiding their influences, denying them even, whereas ALC are happy to play up to them, subverting conventions by being both genre specific and totally unique.<br /><br />On the strength of this offering, A Last Concern are a band Britain (and Leeds in particular) can be proud of, uncompromising, intelligent and most of all a fantastic listen, keep your eyes (and ears) peeled, hopefully more will come of this band.</p>
