        <h1>Yellow Stripe Nine - Look Sharp EP</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Look Sharp EP" recorded by Yellow Stripe Nine. The review was written by James Stringer in 2003.</p>
    <p>Yellow Stripe Nine are a band I've heard of but never heard, until now, and on the basis of this CD I'm wondering why. I'm dead impressed with this CD. Not necessarily the packaging - its a poorly photocopied picture of the band playing with an average looking tracklisting and logo. But the Look Sharp E.P. speaks volumes with what matters - the music. Indie-fied rock is coupled with interesting riffs, catchy choruses are met with musical competence and the superb voice of singer Pete compliments the songs - actual songs - like a fine red wine compliments a smelly cheese.<br><br>Opening number 'Look Sharp' opens with a fast drumbeat, rocking guitars, with bass cutting in and out, before the Vocals come in. And I'm hooked. I want to see this band live now. The dynamics are great on this, bass is clever and guitars working together with riffs and licks instead of a usually strum along that you'd expect. All this and a guy who can sing, from the first song I'm impressed muchly.<br><br>With the second one 'I Love you' we have a quirky little guitar riff and a great syncopated drum beat and a catchy hook of ''even when you say I love you...'' This is a band who while still sounding indie and radio friendly actually sound like that have a basic grasps of their instruments. In fact more than that - they sound like they can play them. What a refreshing change.<br><br>"Take it from me" closes the 3-track CD and it sounds like the Beta band's better stuff, especially in the voice and instrumentation - this is actually a good thing. I dunno if it its the hand claps, infectious harmonies and piano in there somewhere but it really does remind me of the beta band without sounding too much like them.<br><br>This probably won't please everybody, but it has certainly pleased me. Somebody please tell me when they're next playing live, and get them a decent CD cover.</p>
