        <h1>This Days Fury - Nineteen Days To Die</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Nineteen Days To Die" recorded by This Days Fury. The review was written by Russell Leeming in 2006.</p>
    <p>Recently, while looking for my inner soul, I got lost and ended up at an emo cult membership party. I spotted a pale young girl staring blankly out of the window. I asked her what was wrong and she refused to reply. She just sat there and stared at the tempestuous Grandma attacking a nearby oak tree. The Grandma in question had just read the now famous Daily Mail column that accuses emo of being a cult, one that apparently makes kids depressed and disobedient to their parents, and encourages them to slit their wrists. The author in question, Sarah Sands, was obviously having an inspiring day. Take these six words for instance:<br><br>“Emo bands, such as Green Day…”<br><br>Ah, This Days Fury! Let’s for one minute assume The Daily Mail actually talks some sense. I know it’s hard but please put your minds to the test for just one moment, and take in some lyrics from the aforementioned band:<br><br>“Nothing’s enough, your screaming is in vain.”<br>“My life is fading fast, there’s nothing I can do.”<br>“It’s just a shadowed dream of hope.”<br>“I cut the vain that carries all the hatred that I own.”<br>“Time is running out, I’ve lost the race.”<br><br>So there we have it then. This Days Fury are partly responsible for all the depressed and rebellious 15 year olds this planet has on offer. Shame on you.<br><br>Not really.<br><br>Firstly, if Green Day are emo then we’re probably as far away from everybody’s favourite new dart board as is humanly possible. Secondly, This Days Fury play music that, taking a very good guess, is used as a punch bag in order to release their hate and provide something people can relate to. Lets face it, this world is shit. Finally, and most importantly, they provide a very good service to ‘potential depressants’ (for example, anyone currently sexually connected to Darren Day...) who can confide in their music. And the music in question isn't half bad, either.<br><br>Four tracks of fast and rip-roaring cutthroat screamo (get scribbling Sarah…). Throat noises that seemingly only a dose of Cavonia could mend are accompanied by an ever so slightly annoying American accent that certainly bears no resemblance to that of their hometown Dewsbury. However, after a while this set up is warmed to, with the uber-manic screamed verses juxtaposed with choruses of melodic genius. At one point during the EP highlight ‘Nineteen Days To Die’, the singer even sounds like a ‘Holy Bible’ era, James Dean Bradfield, almost launching an attack on his own song (Think ‘Of Walking Abortion’).<br><br>Throughout the course of the EP the pace is relentless yet intelligent, the songs know when to kick in and out and the different vocal pitches used wonderfully blend anger and hatred with realisation and emptiness. All in all, it makes for an intriguing and sometimes challenging listen (see track four, ‘Casualty Of Souls’), but amid the frantic nature of the songs, This Days Fury manage to keep control.<br><br>Obviously, because I’m so “narrow minded” I should dismiss it straight away because it doesn’t sound like… ooh I don’t know, The Kooks or something. But sod it. This is a pulsating rocking beast of an EP that I actually quite like, so if you excuse me Ms Sands, I’ll slit my wrists in peace. Oh, and while you’re at the bar, I’ll have a pint of blood.<br><br>And a packet of guts.</p>
