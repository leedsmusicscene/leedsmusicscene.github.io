    <p>Who are Virgin Voltz<br /><br />Virgin Voltz are Yorkshire born and bred, working class, typical four piece playing a 'not so typical' music style...  each of us comes from different musical backgrounds , with guitar shredding riffs in a rock and roll blues style backed up by the heavy hammering of a punk drummer alongside the thump of a rock bass riffs overseen by powerful indie rock vocals. And when all combined makes a definitive sound that is so addictive you will be back for more! We have been together for a little over twelve months playing  loud, sweaty, in-your-face, dancing-on-tables, jumping-around-like-punks, chanting-back-at-us intimate gigs.<br /><br />What Have They Done?<br /><br />We have been into the recording studio and put down four tracks and are in the process of getting another couple of days squeezed in to get another two possible tracks down for a possible debut EP. Played a handful of gigs outside of Halifax at the likes of The Roadhouse in Manchester and The Shed Bar in Leeds which were a great success.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Sounds Like:<br /><br />100% unique... we are yet to find that one person that can put our sound to a band out there...   Every gig we have played, we have recruited at least one more fan that will leave chanting our trademark songs.... come along and we will definitely have you chanting along with them!<br /><br /> <br />Who are Virgin Voltz<br /><br />Virgin Voltz are Yorkshire born and bred, working class, typical four piece playing a 'not so typical' music style...  each of us comes from different musical backgrounds , with guitar shredding riffs in a rock and roll blues style backed up by the heavy hammering of a punk drummer alongside the thump of a rock bass riffs overseen by powerful indie rock vocals.
