        <h1>Bodixa - Fairytailed</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This is a review of "Fairytailed" recorded by Bodixa. The review was written by Sam Saunders in 2002.</p>
    <p>Star*Bodixa's single on Energy Records has a timeless and glistening appeal. Nostalgic serenity pours out of every verse.<br><br>The yearning harmony vocals, with echoes of great female singers from  Stevie Nicks to Cat Power are the most obvious feature. But there's a tough enough guitar band in there behind them and fairytailed is a real song with comments on sugar coating and rose tinting. It's paired up with aftertaste, a song that sets off in the direction of the tune from Fleetwood Mac's Rhiannon and then reaches its own conclusion: "I'll stand on my own. I won't be the afteraste of what has been before".<br><br>This fine little single is a clear statement of the Star*Bodixa manifesto. There are millions of people who will love their universal wholemeal stuff, and this single release gives radio stations no excuse for not letting them hear it. It's not hip, it's just damn good.
